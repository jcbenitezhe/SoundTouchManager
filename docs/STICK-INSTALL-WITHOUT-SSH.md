# Proposal: first install over the stick boot path instead of app SSH

Status: Track 1 (gated in-app auto-install) shipped. The stick-free :17000 network install has also shipped and is now the primary first-install channel (see `docs/MODELS.md`); it removes the USB stick, opening SSH by cloud-URL injection over :17000. Track 2 proper (a truly SSH-free first-boot bootstrap) is still open, hardware experiment pending. Tracked in a GitHub issue.

## Problem

The desktop app installs the stick agent over an SSH connection to the
speaker. That depends on several fragile conditions at the same time:

1. The box is on the same LAN and reachable.
2. SSH port 22 is open. Bose only opens sshd when the box boots with the
   stick inserted (the `remote_services` marker).
3. Timing: the user has to press "Install" while that access window is
   open.

When any one of these fails, the install aborts with `ssh handshake:
exit status 255` (or similar), and the user has no way to tell which
condition was missing.

Real case (ST10, host `.11`, diagnostic 2026-06-06):
`reachable8090 = true` (box is on the network), `reachableSSH = false`,
`agentVersion = none`. So this is purely a port 22 / timing problem, not
a Wi-Fi or network problem. The install error wrongly blamed the network.
(Partly addressed already: the preflight now probes :8888 and :8090 and
distinguishes "box offline" from "box online, install window closed".)

## What the SSH install actually does today

This is the key finding from reading both paths end to end.

The **stick boot path (`usb-stick/run.sh`) is already fully autonomous.**
With no app and no SSH it: syncs the agent binary to NAND, deploys
`run-override.sh`, runs the complete Wi-Fi provisioning pipeline, applies
region, name and presets, announces over mDNS on :8888, and mirrors a
`setup.log` back to the stick every 25 s.

The **SSH `install.sh` does almost nothing on top of that.** It copies
three things to NAND: `rc.local`, `run-override.sh`, and (first install
only) `presets.json`. Everything else is the boot path's job.

But the one thing it does is the decisive one: it **seeds the first-boot
bootstrap.** Bose firmware runs `/mnt/nv/rc.local` (NAND) at boot, not
anything on the stick. On a factory box `/mnt/nv/rc.local` does not exist
yet. `install.sh` is what writes it. On the `remote_services` stick Bose
opens **sshd and nothing else**, so that SSH channel is the only
first-boot code-execution path STM has. It is not an arbitrary design
choice; it is the bootstrap mechanism.

## The architecture-doc contradiction

`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` used to show an SSH-free first install (Bose
firmware runs `/media/sda1/rc.local` directly on seeing
`remote_services`). The shipping code does not do that, and
`usb-stick/autostart.sh` is marked deprecated in favour of the
`/mnt/nv/rc.local -> run-override.sh` chain. The diagram has been
corrected to match the real flow (app SSHes in, runs `install.sh`,
reboots, the second boot runs from NAND).

Whether Bose can be made to auto-run a stick script at all is the open
hardware question below.

## The real question

Everything reduces to one thing:

> Can we seed `/mnt/nv/rc.local` (the first-boot bootstrap) without SSH?

- If Bose firmware will autonomously execute some script from the stick
  on boot (the old ARCHITECTURE claim, currently **untested**), then SSH
  can be removed entirely and this proposal is fully viable.
- If it will not (what the shipping code implies), then SSH, or some
  equivalent code-execution channel, is irreducible for the *first*
  install, because there is no other way to run the first command on a
  pristine box.

This cannot be settled from code. It needs a hardware experiment.

## Proposed direction (two tracks)

### Track 1: remove the button and the timing, keep SSH hidden

Most of the UX pain is the manual "Install" button and the timing, not
SSH itself. The app can:

- Continuously detect a stock box with :22 open (stick inserted, OOB
  window) during discovery.
- Run `install.sh` automatically in the background the moment it is
  possible, with no user click.
- Show clear status from :8888 and the stick's `setup.log` (no SSH needed
  to read status).

Resulting UX: prepare stick, insert, power on, app shows "installing",
done. That matches the desired flow except SSH stays as the hidden
transport. This needs no new Bose mechanism and can ship independently.

### Track 2: true no-SSH install

A hardware experiment on the test box: a pristine box (no prior STM, so
`/mnt/nv/rc.local` absent), insert the stick, power on, and observe
whether the agent comes up on :8888 / mDNS **without the app ever
SSHing**. If Bose runs any stick script on its own, find the exact
filename it expects and ship the bootstrap there. If it does not, Track 1
is the ceiling and SSH stays.

### Track 2 alpha (v0.7.36): no-USB-boot via the :17000 diagnostic console

For a box that is on the LAN (Bose :8090 answers) but never opened SSH
because it did not read the stick at boot, the installer now tries the
legacy Bose telnet diagnostic console on **TCP 17000** to enable
`remote_services` without a stick boot, then continues the normal SSH
install. This began as a probe for the **SoundTouch 300** (it does not
auto-read the stick at boot) and stubborn **ST30** units, and has since
become the primary first-install channel for every speaker reachable on
the LAN (see `docs/MODELS.md`); the stick is now the fallback. If :17000
does not open SSH the installer falls back to the existing "boot with the
stick" guidance, so nothing regresses.

Note: the shipping technique does not rely on the `remote_services on` TAP
command Bose **removed on firmware 27.x** (community RE writeups and
`deborahgu/soundcork`). Instead it injects a shell payload into the
box's cloud URLs over :17000 (`envswitch boseurls set` / `sys
configuration`, plus a seeded throwaway marge account so the box runs its
check); the firmware executes it on the next marge check, which touches the
`remote_services` marker and starts sshd. This is confirmed live on FW
27.0.6, on the SoundTouch 300 (`ginger`) and the Portable (`taigan`). The
install still logs the :17000 banner and console replies into the desktop
app log for diagnostics.

## Sub-questions from the original proposal, answered

- **Status without an SSH channel:** already solved. `run.sh` mirrors
  `setup.log` to the stick every 25 s, and the agent answers on :8888
  once up. The app can read both without SSH.
- **Security:** an automatic/boot-path install changes nothing about the
  current SSH exposure. The pre-1.0 SSH hardening has shipped: `run.sh`
  (`ensure_sshd_running`) no longer force-starts sshd on every boot. It is
  now opt-in via the `/mnt/nv/stmanager/enable-ssh` NAND marker; by default
  SSH follows Bose's own gate (open while the STM stick is inserted for
  install/recovery/diagnostics, closed on a stickless steady-state boot).
  Track 1 and Track 2 are both neutral to that window.
- **Fallback:** keep the manual SSH install as an expert path in case the
  automatic path does not engage.

## Expected benefit

- Removes the `ssh handshake 255` class of errors from the common path.
- Much simpler UX: insert, power on, done. No timing, no button.
- Less support load (several tickets are exactly this).
