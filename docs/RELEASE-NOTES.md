# Release notes pipeline

How "what changed" reaches users, end to end, and what an update
endpoint has to implement if one is configured.

## One source of truth

Release notes are generated once, at release time, from the
Conventional Commit subjects since the previous tag. They are written
into two places that everything else reads:

1. The **GitHub Release body** (human-readable, on the Releases page).
2. The **`notes` field of `manifest.json`** (machine-readable), which is
   a release asset and is what the website and the desktop app consume.

Nothing scrapes the Releases UI. There is no second, hand-maintained
changelog to keep in sync.

## How it is generated (this repo)

`cmd/relnotes` parses `git log <previous-tag>..<this-tag>` and keeps only
user-facing commit types: `feat` -> New features, `fix` -> Fixes,
`perf` -> Performance, plus anything marked breaking (`type!: ...`).
Noise (`chore`, `ci`, `build`, `test`, `style`, `refactor`, `docs`) is
dropped so the reader sees only what tells them whether to upgrade.

Commit bodies can extend or retract the list. A
`Release-Note: type(scope): summary` trailer anywhere in a body adds an
extra entry, parsed exactly like a subject (useful when a squash merge
collapses several user-visible changes into one subject; the carrier
commit's own type may be non-user-facing). A
`Release-Note-Drop: <summary>` trailer withdraws a previously announced
entry by its rendered summary, case-insensitively, for work that changed
course before the release went out.

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) runs it in the
`release` job:

- `dist/changelog.md` is inserted near the top of the GitHub Release body.
- `dist/notes.json` (`{ "markdown": "...", "items": [...] }`) is merged
  into `manifest.json` under `notes`.

## manifest.json shape (the contract)

`manifest.json` is published as a release asset and is reachable at the
stable URL:

```
https://github.com/jcbenitezhe/SoundTouchManager/releases/latest/download/manifest.json
```

It now contains a `notes` object in addition to the existing fields:

```jsonc
{
  "version": "v0.6.22",
  "build": "2026-06-04-1200",
  "released_at": "2026-06-04T12:00:00Z",
  "commit": "…",
  "artifacts": { "desktop_windows": { "url": "…", "sha256": "…" }, … },
  "notes": {
    "markdown": "## What's changed in v0.6.22\n\n### New features\n\n- …\n",
    "items": [
      { "type": "feat", "scope": "i18n", "summary": "Add Lithuanian", "breaking": false, "commit": "abc123def" },
      { "type": "fix",  "scope": "frontend", "summary": "Sort language filter", "breaking": false, "commit": "…" }
    ]
  }
}
```

`notes.markdown` is a small, safe subset (h2/h3 headings and `-` bullet
lists only). `notes.items` is the same content structured, for richer
rendering.

## What the website has to implement

### 1. The update-check endpoint

No endpoint is configured in this build (`AppInfo.UpdateManifestURL` is
empty), so the app makes no update request. Once one is set, the desktop
app calls it on startup:

```
GET <UpdateManifestURL>?v=<ver>&b=<build>&os=<goos>&arch=<goarch>&lang=<locale>
```

It expects a small JSON object. The app reads `version`, `downloadUrl`,
and optionally `notesUrl`:

```json
{
  "version": "v0.6.22",
  "build": "2026-06-04-1200",
  "downloadUrl": "https://example.org/download/windows",
  "notesUrl": "https://example.org/changelog#v0.6.22"
}
```

Implementation: fetch the latest `manifest.json` (cache it; it changes
only on release) and pick `downloadUrl` from `artifacts` by the
`os`/`arch` query params.

The app shows a **discreet update banner**: the new version plus a single
"What's new" link, no notes inline. `notesUrl` is where that link points.

Constraints the app relies on:
- `notesUrl` is optional. If omitted, the app links to the matching
  GitHub release page derived from `version`
  (`…/releases/tag/<version>`), falling back to the releases list for a
  non-tag version. Set `notesUrl` to point at the website changelog
  instead once that page exists.
- `lang` is sent for future localization. For now notes are English; the
  endpoint can ignore `lang`.
- The full Markdown change list lives in `manifest.json` under
  `notes.markdown` / `notes.items` for the website changelog page; the
  app does not need it inline.

### 2. A changelog / releases page

Render a public changelog from `manifest.json` (latest release) and,
ideally, an archive of past releases. `notes.items` gives you typed
entries (feat/fix/perf, scope, summary) to group and style; or render
`notes.markdown` directly. This page is what "automatically visible on
the website" means: it updates itself on every release because it reads
the manifest, which the release pipeline regenerates.

## What the desktop app already does (this repo)

- `CheckAppUpdate` (desktop-app/app_appinfo.go) forwards the endpoint's full JSON
  to the frontend (including `notesUrl` when present).
- The update banner (desktop-app/frontend/src/main.js, `checkAppUpdate`)
  is kept discreet: version plus a single "What's new" link to the
  release notes, no notes inline.
- The footer version number is also a link to the running version's
  release notes (`renderFooter`).

## Future: localized notes

The app sends `lang`. To localize, translate `notes.markdown` /
`notes.items[].summary` at release time (or in the update endpoint) and
return the translation matching `lang`, falling back to English. Out of
scope for the first iteration by decision; English-from-commits ships
first.
