# Spotify Connect: integration spike

Status: shipped. Spotify Connect went live as a beta in v0.7.0 and has been
hardened through the v0.9.x line (go-librespot sidecar, see the decision
update below); carries the history. The rest of this document is the
spike trail plus the shipping notes, kept for the reasoning behind the
architecture.

## TL;DR (updated after live testing)

**Native Bose Spotify Connect still works and is the primary path; no new
code is needed for the common case.** Live-verified on a taigan Portable
running STM (2026-06-04): a Spotify app on the LAN discovered the speaker
("Living Room 9870"), it authenticated and played an on-demand track
(now_playing `source="SPOTIFY"`, the box connected to Spotify's AP on
port 4070, no stored account). librespot is kept as the future-proof
fallback (built + run-verified on the box, 5.5 MB) for if/when Spotify
ever drops the frozen eSDK. The rest of this document is the spike trail.

## Known limitation: accounts in Spotify's PlayPlay-DRM cohort (2026)

Since roughly December 2025 Spotify has been forcing a per-account DRM
migration: accounts created after a cutoff somewhere in 2024/2025 get
**every** legacy AES audio-key request refused with `code 1`, while older
accounts on the same device, track, and network keep playing. This hits
every open-source Spotify Connect client (go-librespot, librespot-org,
spotifyd); official/eSDK partner clients use the licensed PlayPlay path
and are unaffected, so the box's NATIVE Spotify Connect keeps working for
exactly the accounts that fail on STM's engine.

Signature in the agent log: engine authenticates fine (`authenticated AP`,
`authenticated Login5`), then `failed retrieving aes key with code 1` on
every track ("skipping track ... stopping after N consecutive unplayable
tracks"), often plus `context resolve: 403` and a `429` from the put-state
fallout. Premium status does not matter; family sub-accounts created
recently (e.g. the "Basic Family" plan, which only exists since Nov 2025)
are typical victims.

There is no engine-side fix: OAuth re-login, credential resets, bitrate
and client-token changes are all documented not to help, and implementing
PlayPlay upstream was rejected as a DMCA hazard (go-librespot#317). Our
fork already carries the mitigations that exist (alternative-track
relinking, PR; skip-on-refusal, commit bad77f3). Discriminator for
support: a pre-2024 account plays on the same (STM) device while the new
account does not. Upstream tracking: librespot-org/librespot#1649,
devgianlu/go-librespot#279. First field case: (2026-08-01).

## Decision update (2026-06-04): go-librespot is the open backend, not librespot-org

The earlier spike picked librespot-org (MIT) as the sidecar. Building the
**Spotify-preset** feature surfaced a requirement that flips the choice:
**hardware preset buttons 1..6 must recall a saved Spotify playlist
autonomously**, with no phone app present. That means the box itself must
issue "play URI X".

- **librespot-org has no local control API.** Its only autonomous path is
  the Spotify **Web API** with a refreshable OAuth token **stored on the
  box**, a real security surface and a token-refresh subsystem on every
  user's device.
- **go-librespot ships a local HTTP control API**
  (`POST /player/play {uri}`) that plays a URI from its own cached
  credential, no Web API, no token plane.

So the **primary open backend is go-librespot**; librespot-org stays the
**fallback** (cleaner pure-Rust static build, and its Ogg passthrough is
the audio fallback if a Bose model refuses the live WAV stream).

Costs accepted with go-librespot:
- **Audio is PCM, not Ogg.** Its pipe backend emits s16le only. We wrap it
  as a streaming **WAV** and serve it at `/spotify/stream`; the box plays
  it over UPnP. Bose lists WAV as a supported format, but the live-WAV
  path is the **one on-box unknown to validate** (de-risk: stream any WAV
  to the box's UPnP before trusting the full chain). If it fails, fall
  back to librespot-org + Ogg and revisit control. (Resolved in the end:
  rather than stream WAV, go-librespot was patched to emit **raw Ogg
  passthrough** (`.github/patches/go-librespot-passthrough.patch`,
  `audio_output_pipe_passthrough`), so the box decodes Ogg natively and no
  PCM/WAV is ever served, see "Where the engine comes from" below.)
- **cgo build.** go-librespot decodes Vorbis/FLAC through C (libogg,
  libvorbis, flac), so unlike librespot's pure-Rust static musl it needs a
  cgo cross build. Handled once in CI (`.github/workflows/go-librespot.yml`,
  static-linked armv7 in an emulated Alpine container so it runs on the
  box's glibc 2.15). One-time CI cost vs. an ongoing on-box token plane.

Implementation landed (commit pivoting the manager): `internal/spotify`
supervises go-librespot (config: pipe -> /dev/stdout raw Ogg passthrough
via the STM patch, local API on, zeroconf + persist credentials),
`ServeOgg` streams the audio, `Play` drives recall; `cmd/agent` +
`internal/webui` route both hardware and software Spotify preset presses
to `Play(uri)` + `/spotify/stream.ogg`.

### Where the engine comes from (`third_party/go-librespot`, nothing else)

The speaker's engine is built by `.github/workflows/go-librespot.yml` (and
the engine job in `release.yml`) from **`third_party/go-librespot/`** in this
repository: a vendored copy of the fork's `master` (originally
`JRpersonal/go-librespot`, commit `ca90623d555c`). That source, and only
that source, carries both halves the box needs: the Ogg-passthrough (the box
decodes, the engine never does) and the merged upstream.
`third_party/go-librespot.base` names the last upstream commit it contains;
`upstream-drift.yml` reports what upstream has added since. Locally,
`make engine-build` runs the same recipe into the embed slot.

Building from anything else (an older fork branch, plain upstream) is not a
harmless mistake, because the
failure looks like a box problem: the engine starts, authenticates, and
then refuses every single track with `failed initializing ogg vorbis
stream: vorbis decoder not compiled in this build (pipe passthrough
only)`, while the speaker just sits on a byte-less stream and dies with
`3101 AUDIO_ERROR_BAD_URL`. That cost a deploy round on 2026-08-21.

Rule of thumb: fix it in `third_party/go-librespot`, run the workflow,
verify the artifact's SHA256, hot-swap it onto a test box
(`POST :PORT/api/agent/sidecar`, no reboot needed), then listen through at
least two track changes before believing it.

### Before shipping go-librespot (standing gate)

1. **Security audit of the go-librespot source** at the pinned tag:
   malware / backdoors / data exfiltration / unexpected network calls.
   The bundled binary must be trustworthy for end users.
2. **Validate the live-WAV-over-UPnP path** on real hardware (the one
   unknown above).
3. **Credits**: add go-librespot (and librespot-org) to the project
   credits and the website.
4. **Architecture diagram / docs** updated to show the sidecar + the
   audio (`/spotify/stream`) and control (local API) planes.

### Long tracks: where the memory goes, and the seam mechanism (off)

**Read this first (2026-09-08).** The retention is the SPOTIFY ENGINE's,
not the speaker firmware's, and the seam mechanism described below is
therefore OFF by default. A measurement on a live Portable cut three seams
a megabyte apart while a track played: every seam was accepted, playback
continued, and the box freed nothing (`freedKB` -928, +80, -556, the
effectiveness latch engaged after the third), while the engine's own
resident memory climbed from 19.9 to 22.4 MB across the same three links.
go-librespot's chunked reader keeps every fetched chunk of the current
track in memory (`audio/chunked-reader.go`, one 256 KiB `chunkItem` per
chunk of the whole file, never cleared) and the reader is only dropped at a
track change, which is exactly why a playlist is stable and one long track
is not.

**Fixed in the engine, same night.** The fork releases the chunks the read
position has passed and keeps four behind plus the two prefetched, so the
reader holds 1.75 MiB whatever the track length; a released chunk is
re-downloaded transparently, and the window is switched off while a
completion callback is registered, because that callback reads the whole
file back to persist it to the audio cache (STM pins that cache off, so on
a speaker the window is always active). Measured on the Portable
immediately afterwards, same preset, same length of run: the engine's
resident size settles around 20 MB and stays there for six minutes while
the speaker's free memory is flat, against 19.3 to 24.5 MB and 7.3 MB lost
in two minutes before. The release pipeline builds the engine from the
fork's master, so a release carries it.

What remains valuable on the STM side is the instrument: the engine's
resident size now sits next to the speaker's free memory in the health
line, the heartbeat and the diagnostic file, which is what settled this in
two minutes.

**The field finding (2026-09-07, SoundTouch 20 sm2, FW 27.0.6, 122 MB
RAM).** Memory falls in proportion to the audio delivered *within one
logical Ogg stream* and recovers when a new logical stream begins, i.e. at
a BOS page with a new serial. That reading was consistent with the
firmware holding the buffer, and the paragraph below was built on it; the
measurement above showed the same pattern has a different owner, because
the engine drops its chunk cache at exactly that moment. Ordinary
playlists (3 to 9 minute songs, a BOS between every two) kept
`memAvailableKB` flat for 46 minutes and 45 MB of audio, even inside one
uninterrupted 15-minute HTTP attach. One 60-minute track, a single logical
stream for the whole hour, dropped it monotonically at ~1.25 bytes per byte
of audio (29.9 MB to 3.8 MB in 1092 s) until STM's memory guard rebooted the
box after 20 to 30 minutes. Bluetooth does not leak; an HTTP re-attach, a
pause or a standby frees nothing. The "irreducible ~0.4 MB/min floor" of
the earlier flush-size sweep was this same retention measured across the
frees at track boundaries. Details in `docs/FIRMWARE-NOTES.md`.

**The mechanism (`internal/spotify/oggchain.go`), off unless switched on.**
It gives the decoder a logical-stream boundary of STM's own making: it splits a long track into a chain
of logical streams. At the seam the current page P goes out with the EOS
flag, then the track's own header pages (identification, comment, setup)
are re-emitted under a fresh serial S2 with page sequence 0..h-1, and every
following page is re-stamped with S2 and a contiguous sequence. Granule
positions are never touched (absolute continuation, the late-join shape
the box already decodes), no packet is reassembled, the HTTP connection
and chunking stay as they are. P must complete its last packet (final
lacing value below 255) so the next page starts a fresh packet; a page that
completes no packet, a BOS or an already-EOS page is never P. The decoder
re-initialises from identical headers and the firmware frees the old
link. Cost: a naive cut loses the overlap between the last packet before
and the first after the seam, a quarter block each (a few milliseconds),
at most once every ~10 minutes of a long track. A primer packet that would
make it sample-exact is deliberately not built until a hardware A/B says
which decoder class the box runs; `openLink` is the hook.

**Trigger.** Never inside the first 2 MiB of a link; at the latest at the
ceiling (12 MiB, ~10.5 min at 160 kbps); 4 MiB when meminfo is unreadable.
A `MemAvailable` reading may end a link earlier only when the memory can be
attributed to *that link*, which takes three things together: the reading is
below 12 MiB, it has fallen by at least 0.5 bytes per byte of the link since
the link's first probe (the field leak runs at 1.25), and the link carries at
least 60 s of audio, counted from the granule positions the pages already
carry rather than from wall clock. The level alone is not enough: a box that
sits between the memory guard's 6 MiB and this 12 MiB gate for hours or days
for an unrelated reason (the BoseApp leak family) would otherwise be seamed at
the 2 MiB minimum on every ordinary song, once per ~105 s at 160 kbps and once
per ~52 s at 320, each an audible ~23 ms dropout and one line into the NAND
log, with the effectiveness latch never engaging because each seam does free
its own link. Such a box now only ever sees the 12 MiB ceiling. The baseline
the fall is measured against is the link's first probe, which lands at the
2 MiB minimum (the cadence from there is one probe per 512 KiB of audio, about
twice a minute, no timer) and therefore after the box has finished freeing the
previous link, so it is a settled reading; the price is that a leak at the
field rate seams at ~3.5 MiB rather than at the 2 MiB minimum. Ordinary songs
on a healthy box never see a seam. Three consecutive seams that free under
10 % of their link warn once and stop seaming until the next real track
boundary (the engine holding the memory instead of the firmware).

**Knob / kill switch.** `/mnt/nv/stmanager/spotify-chain-mb`: absent = OFF (the default since 2026-09-08),
`0` = off (byte-identical passthrough), 1..64 = the ceiling in MiB. Read
at engine start, at every real track boundary and after every seam, never
polled, so `echo 0 > /mnt/nv/stmanager/spotify-chain-mb` lands at the next
boundary without a restart; remove the file to return to the default.

**What the log shows.** One Info line per seam, `spotify: chain seam, long
track split so the box frees its stream buffer`, written ~20 s after the
cut (earlier at a real BOS, a detach or the engine exit, then with
`forcedBy`), carrying `track, seam, reason=memory|period|fallback, linkKB,
linkSec, granuleSec, oldSerial, newSerial, memBeforeKB, memAfterKB,
availAtLinkStartKB, fellKB, fellPerByte, freedKB, probeSec, engineRSSKB`.
`freedKB` positive and roughly `linkKB * 1.25` confirms the mechanism;
`availAtLinkStartKB`, `fellKB` and `fellPerByte` are the evidence a
`reason=memory` seam was judged on, so a bundle shows whether the box really
was losing memory to that link (`fellPerByte` at or above 0.50, the field
value ~1.25) or was merely low; the latch warning `chain seams are not
freeing memory on this box` marks the other cases. `resource health` lines and
the crash heartbeat now carry `engineRSSKB` (a climb in step with the
audio means go-librespot's chunk reader holds the track and the fix
belongs in the fork), the detach line carries `seams`, and the
`spotify_chain` section of `/api/debug/state` keeps the last seam's
readings for a bundle after the NAND ring has rolled.

### Lyrics run ahead of the audio: the buffer lag is measured, not corrected

Field report (2026-09): with STM's Spotify entry the lyrics in the Spotify
app run ahead of the sound, with the speaker's own Spotify entry they line
up. The mechanism follows from the architecture above. go-librespot reports
its position from the bytes it has written to the pipe, while that audio is
still travelling through STM's batch and the box's own buffer, and STM
deliberately keeps roughly ten seconds there (`leadCapSec` in
`internal/spotify/engine.go`, the flush batch in `drain.go`). The app shows
the delivered position; the lyrics follow the app.

What was never known is the size of the offset on real hardware, and any
correction applied before that number exists would be a guess. So
`internal/spotify/boxlag.go` measures it and does nothing else: the drain
publishes the delivered timeline of the last page it handed to the box, the
speaker's own clock comes from UPnP `RelPosition` (`GetPositionInfo`'s
`RelTime`), and the difference is logged as `spotify: buffer lag measured
(audio delivered vs audio played)` with both sides and `diffSec`. The last
reading is also in the `spotify_chain` section of `/api/debug/state`, so a
field bundle carries it after the NAND ring has rolled.

Event-driven only, once per attachment and once per track boundary: no
ticker, no standing poll, nothing on the wire while nothing happens. A
boundary caused by a skip is labelled `track-boundary after a skip`, because
the box drops its buffer there and both clocks are mid-jump.

The two clocks only mean something against a shared base, which is most of
what the code does:

- The baseline is taken in the drain, on the first audio page the new
  attachment actually receives, not where the box attached. The engine keeps
  producing while no box is attached (`engineHot`, see `recall.go`), so the
  delivered counter at the attach instant is the value at the PREVIOUS
  detach, and basing on it folded that whole detached window into every later
  reading of the attachment.
- Delivered counts only audio handed to the box. The pages a skip cut throws
  away, and a batch dropped when the box goes, are never played, so the
  box's `RelTime` cannot contain them; counting them inflated every later
  reading by up to a full lead cap, i.e. by the same order of magnitude as
  the quantity being measured.
- The delivered timeline carries across go-librespot runs. The sink outlives
  one engine run by design (crash restart, volume-config restart, the OTA
  sidecar swap), and a per-run counter starting at zero under an attached box
  made every later reading negative.
- `RelPosition` reports whether the field was READABLE, not whether the call
  succeeded. Bose answers `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` for fields it has no value for,
  which parses as zero, and a zero box clock reads as the largest lag the
  measurement can express. No usable clock means no line and no stored
  reading; the same goes for a baseline that has not been taken yet and for a
  timeline that was rebuilt underneath the box. A missing number is worth
  more than a plausible wrong one.

## Why native Spotify works without the Bose cloud

Spotify Connect has two login paths. Bose's app used the **account-linked**
one: enter your account in the Bose iOS app, the Bose cloud brokered the
Spotify OAuth and stored the account on the speaker so it appeared
everywhere. That broker (the Bose cloud) is dead, which is why the account
can no longer be changed from the Bose app.

But the **zeroconf path** is independent and alive: the speaker's eSDK
advertises Spotify Connect on the LAN; the user's Spotify app (logged in
to their account) discovers it and performs the login handshake **itself**,
handing the speaker a one-time credential derived from the app's own
session (via the eSDK's Diffie-Hellman exchange). The speaker logs in to
Spotify's AP (port 4070) directly and streams from the CDN. The Bose cloud
is never in this path, so it survived the shutdown. Evidence:
now_playing shows `sourceAccount="SpotifyConnectUserName"` with no stored
account, and the box holds a live TCP connection to a Spotify AP on 4070.

## Connecting accounts (there is no "linking" step)

Any Spotify account just: open the Spotify app on the same Wi-Fi as the
speaker, tap the device picker, choose the speaker, play. The app does the
auth; whoever connects last controls it. No Bose app, no stored account,
no cloud, no STM config. The only thing lost versus the old Bose flow is
the permanent "appears everywhere under one account" presence (that needed
the cloud-brokered stored account); the practical pick-and-play works.

STM's role: the marge stub answers the Bose cloud source-provider list,
so BoseApp enables the SPOTIFY source, loads the eSDK, and advertises
zeroconf. STM therefore likely delivers native Spotify essentially for
free (to confirm: whether a post-cloud box without STM leaves the source
disabled).

## Goal

A SoundTouch speaker running STM should be linkable to one or more
Spotify accounts and then appear as a playback target ("device") in the
Spotify app, so a user picks it in the app and audio plays on the
speaker. The Spotify setting is network-wide: it is configured once in
the desktop app and rolled out to every speaker on the LAN.

## The constraint (why the old path is dead)

The SoundTouch firmware's built-in Spotify Connect hung off Bose-issued
Spotify partner credentials baked into the cloud. With the cloud gone and
the OEM agreement ended, the speaker's native Spotify source no longer
authenticates and cannot be revived. Playback therefore has to come from
a Spotify Connect implementation STM controls, not the speaker's dead
built-in source. See for the longer history.

## How Spotify Connect actually works

A Connect "device" advertises itself on the LAN over mDNS/zeroconf
(`_spotify-connect._tcp`). The Spotify app discovers it and authenticates
through Spotify's own servers, so:

- **No password is stored on the device** in zeroconf/discovery mode. The
  user picks the device in their app and it just works.
- **Multiple accounts work for free**: anyone on the LAN sees the device
  and can take it over from their own app. This satisfies "one or more
  accounts" with zero per-account configuration.

This is the UX the goal asks for, and it is implemented by the open
`librespot` family.

## Building blocks (researched)

| Project | Lang | License | Zeroconf | Audio out | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) | Rust | **MIT** | yes (discovery mode) | ALSA, pipe, subprocess, ... | Reference impl. MIT = clean to bundle. |
| [go-librespot](https://github.com/devgianlu/go-librespot) | Go | **GPL-3.0** | yes (builtin mDNS or avahi) | ALSA, PulseAudio, **pipe** (s16le/f32le) | Active. Has an HTTP control API. GPL matters, see below. |
| [AfterTouch / gesellix](https://github.com/gesellix/Bose-SoundTouch) | Go | - | - | - | Community post-cloud SoundTouch toolkit; references for the box side. |

### Licensing (decisive)

STM is MIT. **go-librespot is GPL-3.0, so its Go packages must never be
imported/linked into STM's Go code** (that would force STM to GPL).
Either implementation may only be used as a **separate sidecar binary**
invoked over a process boundary (exec + its HTTP API / pipe), which is
mere aggregation, not a derivative work. STM uses go-librespot exactly
this way: it execs the binary and talks to it over localhost HTTP, never
importing its packages, so STM stays MIT. Shipping a GPL-3.0 binary
obliges us to offer its source; it is public and the build is pinned +
Sigstore-attested (`go-librespot.yml`). See the Decision update at the
top: go-librespot is chosen for its local control API; librespot-org
(MIT, no GPL obligation) remains the fallback.

## Where does the audio go?

A Connect receiver decodes the Spotify stream to PCM and needs an audio
sink. On the box, Bose owns the audio output, which first looked like the
hard blocker. It is not: STM already plays audio on the box by pointing
its UPnP at an HTTP stream, so the on-box receiver can feed that same path
on loopback (see Architecture A). The design:

### Architecture A: on-box sidecar (the chosen path)

The STM agent ships and supervises a librespot sidecar **on the speaker**
in zeroconf mode, so the box itself appears as its own Connect device.
No PC has to be running; the network-wide config is rolled out to every
agent and each box self-advertises.

**The audio path is the key insight, and it is already solved in STM.**
STM does not write audio to ALSA; it plays on the speaker by pointing the
box's own UPnP AVTransport at an HTTP stream URL (the radio path,
Box:8091). Architecture A reuses exactly that:

1. on-box librespot runs in zeroconf mode (box = the Connect device);
2. when a user plays, librespot decodes to a **local HTTP stream** served
   by the agent's stream layer (pipe backend -> PCM/WAV over HTTP, or a
   light transcode);
3. the agent tells the box's own UPnP to play
   `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/spotify`.

So there is no direct ALSA access and no fight with Bose's audio
ownership: Spotify audio reaches the speaker over the same proven path as
radio. The remaining unknowns shrink to a hardware session:

- librespot ARMv7l build (Rust, MIT) and NAND footprint, stripped.
- sustained CPU on the weakest model (ST10): decode + serve/transcode.
- play / pause / seek latency through the Bose UPnP buffer.
- track metadata: surface the current title via the agent's now-playing.

### Architecture B: desktop bridge (fallback only)

librespot runs on the desktop host instead, advertising one device per
speaker and re-streaming to the box via UPnP. This was considered and
**rejected as the primary path**: its one distinguishing piece (re-stream
from the PC) is thrown away in A, so it does not de-risk A's real
question, and it forces the PC to stay on while the device shown is a
PC-hosted proxy, not the box itself. Keep B in reserve only if librespot
turns out not to run on the box at all (NAND / CPU limits).

## Network-wide config and rollout

Per the requirement, Spotify is one network-wide setting, configured in
the desktop app and applied to all speakers:

- A single `spotify` config object (at least: `enabled`, device-naming
  pattern, bitrate, normalization) lives in the desktop app.
- **Architecture A:** the desktop app pushes that config to every
  discovered agent (a new `/api/spotify/config` on the agent, same
  rollout pattern as presets/region). Each agent starts/stops and
  configures its own librespot sidecar. Each box self-advertises, so
  multi-box is natural.
- **Architecture B:** the desktop app owns N librespot instances (one per
  speaker) directly; "network-wide" is intrinsic since one app manages
  all of them. Heavier on the host (N decoders, N streams).
- Multi-account needs no rollout: zeroconf stores no credentials, so the
  same `enabled` config gives every account on the LAN access to every
  speaker.

## Proof-of-concept plan (Architecture A, on approval)

A hardware session on the test speaker (SSH to the maintainer's own box
on his LAN):

1. Cross-compile librespot for ARMv7l (Rust, MIT), strip it, and check
   the NAND footprint against free space.
2. Run it on the box in zeroconf mode; confirm the box appears in the
   Spotify app and a session starts (no audio yet).
3. pipe backend -> a minimal agent HTTP endpoint that serves the PCM/WAV
   stream on loopback.
4. Point the box's own UPnP AVTransport at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/...`;
   confirm audio plays on the speaker and measure play/pause/seek latency.
5. Measure sustained CPU on the weakest reachable model.
6. Then wrap it: agent supervises the sidecar; a new `/api/spotify/config`
   receives the network-wide config the desktop app rolls out to all
   agents; surface track metadata via now-playing.

## Component choice: native eSDK now, librespot as the fallback

(Updated: the on-box test showed the native eSDK actually works via
zeroconf, see the TL;DR. So native is the primary path today; the
analysis below is why librespot is kept ready as the fallback for the
frozen-component risk, not why it is primary.)

The speaker already ships Spotify's official embedded SDK
(`/usr/lib/libspotify_embedded_shared.so`, dated Aug 2022) plus the audio
socket `/var/volatile/tmp/spotifyaudio.uds`. Bose used the account-linked
Connect model: you entered your Spotify account in the Bose iOS app, the
Bose cloud brokered the Spotify OAuth and pushed the credential to the
speaker, which logged in and registered with Spotify so it appeared in
your app everywhere. Only that broker (the Bose cloud) is dead; the eSDK
itself is intact.

Reusing the eSDK is in fact the primary path: it works today (zeroconf,
no cloud, verified). But it carries one structural risk that keeps
librespot in reserve:

- The eSDK is **frozen at Aug 2022 and will never be updated by Bose**.
  When Spotify next deprecates the protocol version or revokes the
  embedded partner key, native Spotify dies with no recourse, the exact
  vendor-abandonment failure STM exists to undo.
- Driving a closed Spotify C library with Bose's partner key outside
  Bose's flow is heavy reverse engineering with uncertain payoff.

### librespot on-box results (live, 2026-06-04)

Validated end to end on the taigan Portable except the final audio
plumbing:

- Builds + runs (static musl). OAuth login works; the credential is
  cached to `credentials.json` and is **persistent (survives reboot)** ,
  this is the session cache that makes autonomous presets possible.
- Authenticated as a Premium account and registered as a Spotify Connect
  device; it even shows up account-bound ("devices on another network")
  since local zeroconf is off on this box. **librespot refuses Free
  accounts** (`does not support "free" accounts`); the native eSDK does
  not, so Free users keep native live Spotify, presets are Premium-only
  (on-demand recall needs Premium anyway).
- **Idle RAM ~4 MB** (VmRSS 4208 kB), NAND 5.5 MB. Footprint is a
  non-issue.
- Control path works: pressing play in the app makes librespot decode and
  emit audio to the pipe backend.
- Audio routing is the one remaining build: run librespot with
  **`-P/--passthrough`** so it emits the raw Ogg/Vorbis stream (not PCM),
  have the agent serve that over HTTP (streamproxy), and point the box's
  own UPnP at it, so the Bose firmware decodes the Ogg (offloading the
  Cortex-A8). Then preset save/recall: a preset stores the Spotify URI,
  recall tells librespot to play it and routes the audio this way.
  (Pitfall found: without `--passthrough`, librespot writes raw PCM at
  ~176 KB/s; never let that land on NAND.)

librespot is the fallback because it is **open, actively
maintained (v0.8.0, Nov 2025), and STM controls its update path**: if
Spotify ever drops the frozen eSDK, we rebuild librespot from source and
ship it over OTA. It also does the
same **account-linked** model via its OAuth login (`librespot-oauth`), so
the familiar "appears in your Spotify app under your account" UX is
preserved, not just local zeroconf. This mirrors STM already replacing
the dead TuneIn integration with radio-browser. The eSDK reuse stays
documented only as a rejected alternative.

## How login works (no special Spotify partnership) and the data flow

librespot has no partner status with Spotify; it is reverse-engineered.
The robust, least-grey login is **zeroconf**, where Spotify's own app
does the authentication:

1. librespot advertises `_spotify-connect._tcp` on the LAN.
2. The user's official Spotify app (same LAN) discovers the device and,
   being legitimately logged in, performs the auth and hands librespot a
   reusable session credential. librespot itself does no OAuth here.
3. librespot logs in to `ap.spotify.com` with that credential and
   registers the device with Spotify's backend. From then on it shows up
   in the user's Spotify app, including remotely, exactly the
   account-linked UX Bose had. One-time LAN login, then account-bound.

Data flow during playback: control ("play on device X") goes through
Spotify's servers to librespot; librespot pulls the encrypted Ogg from
Spotify's CDN, decrypts it, and with `passthrough-decoder` hands the Ogg
through undecoded to the box, whose Bose firmware decodes and plays it
(Architecture A). Audio never streams phone-to-speaker directly.

A standalone OAuth path also exists (`librespot-oauth`, using a public
Spotify client id) but it is the more fragile, greyer route and is not
needed when zeroconf is used. The residual risk that Spotify breaks
unofficial clients is the reason for choosing a maintained OSS component
we can rebuild and ship over OTA.

The frozen Bose eSDK keeps no idle footprint to stop: `ps` shows no
Spotify process; the eSDK is loaded on demand only when Bose's (now
account-less, dead) Spotify source is selected. Integration just avoids
triggering it and ensures only librespot advertises Spotify Connect.

## Spike results so far

- **Build (transparent, from source):** `.github/workflows/librespot.yml`
  builds librespot v0.8.0 from source as a static-musl armv7 binary,
  size-optimised, Sigstore-attested, no opaque blob. Features:
  `with-libmdns` (zeroconf), `rustls-tls-webpki-roots` (pure-Rust TLS, no
  OpenSSL), `passthrough-decoder` (pass Ogg/Vorbis through so the Bose
  firmware decodes it, not the Cortex-A8). No ALSA.
- **Footprint:** the binary is **5.5 MB** (5,542,460 bytes). The box has
  ~20.4 MB free on `/mnt/nv`; the STM agent is 11.3 MB, so agent +
  librespot is ~17 MB, under budget. NAND is **not** a blocker, and a
  hand-rolled client would not save meaningful disk (a Go binary would be
  similar or larger). The library-vs-custom question therefore comes down
  to runtime RAM/CPU, not size.
- **Box profile (taigan Portable):** armv7l, single-core Cortex-A8
  (AM33XX) with NEON, glibc 2.15 (hence static musl), ~52 MB RAM
  available. CPU/RAM at runtime is the one open risk; `passthrough-decoder`
  exists specifically to keep decode off the box.
- **On-box run (taigan Portable, live):** the static-musl binary
  **executes** on the box (`librespot 0.8.0 ... exit 0`), confirming the
  build is compatible. With the 5.5 MB binary on `/mnt/nv` there is still
  14.6 MB free.
- **zeroconf is blocked on this box:** the kernel (3.14) has **no IPv6**
  (`/proc/net/if_inet6` absent, no `net.ipv6` sysctl), so libmdns's
  discovery server fails to bind (`os error 97`, EAFNOSUPPORT) and
  librespot, with no discovery and no credentials, exits. `avahi-daemon`
  is installed but not running.
- **Therefore the credential/OAuth path is the one for this hardware:**
  librespot with a provided credential authenticates straight to
  `ap.spotify.com` with no discovery server, side-stepping the IPv6
  issue, and it is exactly the account-linked model (device appears in
  the user's Spotify app). The zeroconf-is-cleaner point is moot here
  because the box cannot run the mDNS responder. (Alternative, not
  chosen: build `with-avahi` and run the box's avahi-daemon, more moving
  parts and Bose-mDNS conflict risk.)
- **Still to measure (needs a one-time OAuth login):** run librespot with
  cached OAuth credentials so it stays up, then idle RAM/CPU, CPU during
  a session, and play/pause/seek latency through the box's UPnP buffer.

## Spotify presets via librespot (multi-account design)

Native eSDK gives live Spotify but cannot recall a preset autonomously
(no persistent session). librespot with a cached credential can: a preset
holds a Spotify URI, recall tells librespot to play it, audio routes to
the box. The vision (which the Bose original never did): several household
members each log in their own Spotify account and save their own
playlists; a preset tile shows it is Spotify and whose account it is.

Data model (done, `internal/presets`): a preset carries `Type="spotify"`,
`URI` (the resource), and `Account` (whose it is) instead of a StreamURL.

Build phases:
- **P0 foundation (done):** preset model carries URI + Account, tested.
- **P1 single account:** agent supervises one librespot (cached cred,
  `--passthrough`), serves its Ogg over HTTP (streamproxy), recall =
  librespot play URI -> box UPnP plays the Ogg. Frontend: save the
  current Spotify now-playing as a preset (capture the URI) and play it.
- **P2 multi-account:** per-account cached credentials; a preset's
  `Account` selects which credential/session plays it (one librespot per
  account, or switch). OAuth done once per account.
- **P3 UI:** preset tiles show a Spotify badge + the account, so each
  member recognises their own.

Prerequisites that are their own work: the OAuth credential must reach
the box (desktop app does the OAuth in a webview, pushes the credential),
and librespot must be deployed (built in CI, see librespot.yml; shipped
on the stick / via OTA, MIT so bundling is fine after the security
audit).

## Before shipping (mandatory gates)

Once the on-box test confirms librespot works, these must be done before
it ships to any user:

1. **Security audit of the librespot source at the pinned tag.** STM
   bundles a binary that runs on users' speakers, so review for
   backdoors, malware, data exfiltration, and unexpected outbound
   endpoints; sanity-check the dependency tree (the Cargo.lock) and
   diff the pinned tag against upstream. Pin to an audited tag and only
   bump after re-auditing. Users must not be surprised one day.
2. **Credits / thanks.** Add librespot (librespot-org, MIT) to the
   project's credits, alongside the existing community acknowledgements.
3. **Website.** Add librespot to the credits/acknowledgements on
   the website (`site/`) and describe the Spotify feature on the relevant page.
4. **Architecture.** Add the librespot sidecar + the Ogg-passthrough ->
   UPnP-loopback path to docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (component map + the
   external-dependency / data-flow tables) and the CLAUDE.md diagram.

## Acceptance for closing

This doc plus a working (even hacky) PoC of the chosen path on at least
one model, and the remaining blockers before it can ship to all users
(licensing posture for the bundled sidecar, NAND footprint for A, the
PC-on caveat for B).

## Falsified / non-options

- Reviving the speaker's native Spotify source: impossible without Bose
  partner credentials.
- 30-second Web API previews: useless for real playback.
- Importing go-librespot into STM's Go modules: license-incompatible
  (GPL-3.0 vs MIT). Sidecar only.
