# STM Roadmap

Forward-looking items beyond the v1.0 gate defined in `CLAUDE.md`.
This is a wishlist with rough sequencing, not a commitment. Items
move in and out as reality lands.

For the security-specific roadmap see
[`docs/THREAT-MODEL.md`](THREAT-MODEL.md#hardening-roadmap).

## Post-1.0 (already named in CLAUDE.md)

- In-app self-update on macOS. The download is Developer ID signed and
  notarized since v0.9.33, so Gatekeeper is no longer the blocker;
  what is missing is replacing a running `.app` bundle in place, so
  the macOS updater stays assisted (download, verify, open the DMG).
  (Code signing itself is DONE on both desktop platforms: Windows
  Certum-signed since v0.9.20, macOS signed and notarized since
  v0.9.33.)
- Promote the remaining model statuses to Verified (Portable is
  Verified, ST20 spotty contributor-confirmed, ST30 live-confirmed;
  see [`MODELS.md`](MODELS.md)).
- Wails sandboxing on macOS and Windows.

## In-flight engineering

These are tracked here because they span multiple PRs and need a
durable home so future sessions do not re-scope or duplicate the
work. Distinct from the post-1.0 items above: scheduling here is
"next few PRs", not "after v1.0".

### Frontend refactor of `desktop-app/frontend/src/main.js`

Started 2026-05-17. Goal: split the `main.js` monolith (~3500 lines
then, **6892 lines as of 2026-06-12**) into focused modules, add
i18n, switch the default UI to English.

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| A | Extract leaf modules (`state`, `utils`, `localization`, `logos`, `api`) out of `main.js`. All comments and identifiers English. | **done** |
| B | Extract view modules + shared services along the existing section-comment seams (see the refactoring backlog below for the concrete module cut). After this `main.js` shrinks to the DOM skeleton + router + bootstrap (~600 lines; the old ~150-line estimate predates the feature growth). | in progress — 7 view modules extracted to `src/views/` (library, multiroom, podcasts, recent, settings, setup, spotify) plus service modules (`api`, `groups`, `searchflow`, `share`); `main.js` still holds over 8000 lines (it has grown with the features, not shrunk), so finishing the cut remains the highest-leverage refactor in the repo |
| C | i18n system: minimal `t()` helper plus `en` and `de` bundles in `desktop-app/frontend/src/i18n/`. Locale detected from `navigator.language`, with explicit override stored in `localStorage`. **Default is English** per the global-audience rule; German remains a first-class supported locale but is no longer the implicit fallback. | **done** — shipped and grown to 13 locale bundles (incl. Arabic). All bundles are complete (key-for-key with `en.json`); the completeness gap was closed. |
| D | Translate the remaining inline German comments and the few mixed-language handler strings still sitting in `main.js` (and any view module that ends up holding them after Phase B). Closes the CLAUDE.md "all code/comments/identifiers in English" rule. | mostly done via the i18n sweep; ~a dozen German comments remain in `main.js` (and the older on-stick scripts are still German, tracked in the backlog below) — finish when Phase B touches those regions |

Why this is on the roadmap rather than just done: Phase A alone
was ~600 lines of careful diff and surfaced six unrelated bugs
that we durably fixed in flight. Phase B+C are bigger
still; the right move is one PR per phase so each is reviewable
and any regression can be bisected to its phase.

### Refactoring backlog (audited 2026-06-12)

Result of a full-repo refactor audit, prioritized by payoff/risk.
Each item is a single reviewable PR; line numbers as of v0.7.21.

**Correctness-adjacent (do first, small):**

1. **done** — `runSSHWithFlags`/`runSSHWithFlagsStdin` were rewritten on
   `exec.CommandContext`, the `appCtx()` nil-ctx guard shipped, and the
   LAN-sweep drain starts before spawning.
2. Unify the six hand-rolled reboot variants and five SSH-handshake
   policies on the hardened forms (`sync; /sbin/reboot` detached;
   4x retry handshake) — the lesson is currently unapplied on
   the uninstall/factory-reset/OTA paths.
3. **done** — the box preset sync pushes the proxy slot URL, not the raw
   `StreamURL` (the handler now lives in `internal/webui/presets_http.go`
   after the 14-file split).
4. **done** — `boxws` parses typed frames instead of sniffing whole-frame
   substrings, so a track title containing `STOP_STATE` can no longer fire
   the user-stop suppressor; `presetsUpdated` parsing landed on the same
   seam (`internal/boxws/frames.go`).
5. **done** — the SSRF dial guard moved into `internal/netutil` and is
   shared by the stream proxy and `internal/upnp`'s playlist fetches; the
   `extractStreamFromPlaylist` short read was fixed with it.

**Structure (mechanical, medium):**

6. Single source for the box-facing loopback URLs
   (`/stream/<slot>`, `/spotify/stream-<slot>.ogg`, `/stream/raw?u=`):
   today stamped out at 9+ sites across `cmd/agent`, `webui`, and the
   frontend; the v0.7.21 self-proxy regression was this class.
7. Unify the dual Spotify recall paths (hardware
   `playSpotifyPreset` vs app `handlePlaySlot`) into one orchestrator:
   they have already drifted (the soft verify still carries the
   restart-on-re-Play bug the hardware path fixed in v0.7.4).
8. **done** — all five splits landed: `desktop-app/app.go` (now ~190
   lines + 15 focused files incl. `boxssh.go`), `cmd/agent/main.go`
   (10 files), `internal/webui` (14-file split, `webui.go` removed),
   `internal/spotify/manager.go`, and
   `internal/streamproxy/streamproxy.go`.
9. Frontend Phase B (see table above): cut `main.js` along its
   existing section comments into ~9 view modules + 6 services;
   pre-step: decompose the 910-line `renderBoxSettings`.

**Guardrails (CI, small):**

10. **partly done** — CI now builds, vets and tests the `desktop-app`
    module, and `busybox sh -n` runs over `run.sh` next to shellcheck.
    Still open: the `wails generate module` freshness check and the
    i18n key-completeness report (the completeness gap #514 closed by
    hand is exactly what that report would catch automatically).
11. Tests for the privacy sanitizers in `logexport.go`
    (anonymize IP/MAC/SSID/serial) — a silent regression there leaks
    user data into public issue attachments. Then: boxws frame
    parser, upnp SOAP golden tests, version helpers.
12. `usb-stick/run.sh` (3461 lines): keep single-file (the
    rc.local copy chain forbids sourcing siblings) but add a
    table-of-contents header, the BusyBox parse gate above, and a
    parity test for the duplicated `lang_int_for_cc` table.

## Under consideration

### iOS web app (PWA) installable from the website

Idea: the user opens the project website on an iPhone, taps "Add to Home
Screen", and from then on has an app icon that controls the local
SoundTouch speakers without going through the desktop app.

Scope on day one would be the same surface the desktop app exposes:
discover running agents on the LAN, browse internet radio, manage
presets, control playback.

**Feasibility: needs a study before this gets scheduled.** Several
hard blockers exist and a clean answer to each is a prerequisite:

1. **Mixed content / TLS.** A PWA served from `https://jcbenitezhe.github.io`
   cannot call `http://<speaker-lan-ip>:8888` from a SecureContext.
   Safari blocks the request before it leaves the page.
   Mitigation paths:
   - Agent serves HTTPS with a cert signed by an STM root CA that
     the user installs once via a configuration profile on iOS.
     `internal/tlsgen` already produces per-agent certs; the gap is
     the trust anchor on the client.
   - Or: ship the PWA from the agent itself over plain HTTP. iOS
     refuses to register service workers off `localhost` without
     TLS, so "installable" likely degrades to "bookmarked website".
2. **Discovery.** Browsers have no mDNS / DNS-SD API. The PWA cannot
   see `_stmanager._tcp.local` the way the desktop app does. Options:
   - Manual IP entry on first launch.
   - QR code printed by the desktop app or shown in the setup
     wizard, encoding `https://<ip>:<port>` plus a pairing token.
   - Optional: a tiny local-only helper on the user's router or NAS,
     but that pushes the install bar back up.
3. **Background and lock-screen control.** iOS PWAs do not get
   MediaSession lock-screen controls the way native apps do, and
   they suspend aggressively in the background. Playback control
   from the lock screen is almost certainly out of scope for v1 of
   the PWA.
4. **Persistence and storage.** iOS evicts PWA storage after roughly
   seven days of non-use. Presets and settings must be source-of-
   truth on the agent, not in the PWA. This actually fits STM's
   existing architecture, but is worth confirming.
5. **Hardware volume buttons.** Coupling the phone's volume side
   buttons to the speaker volume while the page is open (user wish,
   2026-07-26) is not possible from a web page: Safari exposes no
   event for the hardware buttons, `HTMLMediaElement.volume` is
   read-only on iOS, and there is no system-volume change event a
   page could observe. This needs a native shell (the buttons are
   only observable from a native audio session), so it lands here
   as a native-app argument, not in the web UI.

If the TLS-trust story can be made acceptable (one-tap profile
install with a clear consent screen, or a route that does not need
a custom CA at all), this is worth doing. If it requires walking
users through manual certificate trust dialogs, it is not.

### Factory reset wizard in the desktop app

A guided flow in the desktop app that takes a paired speaker back to
a known state without making the user open a shell. Useful when
selling or giving away a speaker, when moving to a different Wi-Fi
network, or when an install has ended up in a corrupt state and the
user wants to try again from scratch.

The wizard should offer at least three levels, in increasing
severity, and explain in plain language what each does before it
runs:

1. **Reset STM data only.** Clears the preset store and any
   per-device settings on the agent. Wi-Fi, the NAND override, and
   the agent binary stay in place. Reversible: the user can
   re-add presets.
2. **Reset Wi-Fi.** Rewrites `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf` to drop the
   current network so the speaker comes back up in its own setup
   mode on the next boot. The user reconnects via the desktop app
   or the USB stick.
3. **Uninstall STM.** Removes `/mnt/nv/stmanager/` and the NAND
   override so the speaker boots stock Bose firmware again. After
   this the speaker has no working internet radio (Bose cloud is
   dead), so the wizard must warn that the USB stick is needed to
   reinstall.

Hard requirements that must hold before this ships:

- Every level must be **idempotent** and safe to interrupt. A wizard
  step that half-writes the NAND override file and then dies leaves
  the speaker in a worse state than before.
- The "uninstall" path must not touch `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf`
  unless explicitly selected, so a user who only wants STM gone
  keeps their Wi-Fi working.
- The agent must expose a dedicated reset endpoint. The desktop app
  should never SSH into the box for this; SSH-root with a known
  password is the very thing
  [[project-box-security-hardening]] is trying to close.
- The USB stick remains the recovery medium of last resort. If the
  wizard breaks something, plugging the stick back in must fix it
  (per [[feedback-stick-is-recovery]]). The wizard reset paths and
  the stick boot scripts must converge on the same expected state.

Tracked as a GitHub issue under the `enhancement` label.

**Status:** Level 2 shipped in v0.5.17 as `TrueFactoryReset`
(commit `5ddc6e8`); level 3 shipped as `UninstallSTM` (Speaker
Settings → Remove STM, with a stick-present safeguard; removes
`/mnt/nv/stmanager/` and the boot override). Only level 1 (reset STM
data only) is still open. Both shipped levels currently ride the
SSH channel. SSH is already opt-in since v0.8.1 (sshd is closed by
default on a stickless box and must be opened first), so the
remaining v1.0 goal is to migrate these reset paths to a dedicated
agent reset endpoint (see the requirement above) that needs no root
SSH at all.

### Other ideas (loose)

- Android phone remote: a small **native Android app** is the chosen
  direction, deliberately not scheduled yet.
  Unlike iOS Safari, Chrome installs a page as a real app only from a
  trusted HTTPS origin, so the same PWA served over LAN HTTP lands as a
  browser shortcut, not an installable app; the browser workarounds (a
  public cert for a LAN IP, or a user-installed root CA) each trade a
  real security property for a cosmetic one.
- Multi-room grouping: **shipped** since the v0.7.x line — native
  `/setZone` plus a per-agent mirror fallback, NAND-persisted zones
  with auto-reform, an opt-in permanent group, and stereo pairs.
  Ongoing: stability hardening from broader hardware feedback.
- Spotify Connect: **shipped** since the v0.7.x line via a
  supervised go-librespot sidecar with Ogg passthrough, per-slot
  stream URLs, Spotify presets, per-speaker quality and multi-account.
  Ongoing: stability hardening, native multi-account upstream (fork
  issue), upstreaming the passthrough patch (devgianlu PR).
- Additional streaming providers. STM plays
  radio and Spotify today; SoundCloud, Amazon Music and **Deezer** are
  candidates. **Deezer is wanted** by users whose existing Deezer
  station-key presets still work after the Bose shutdown (the cloud
  source survived where radio did not). Two distinct pieces:
  - **Preserve, then import.** Done. An STM install no longer
    overwrites existing speaker presets, the agent reads every box-owned
    `ContentItem` from `presetsUpdated`, and the app shows a Deezer key
    as the speaker's own tile that recalls through the speaker's saved
    login. The slot picker marks such a key as taken and asks for a
    second tap before an STM station replaces it.
  - **Create new Deezer presets** from STM. This needs a Deezer
    integration (auth + the playable URL shape) and is the larger,
    later piece. First action is collecting an anonymised example of a
    working Deezer preset URL from a user's box XML to learn the format.
