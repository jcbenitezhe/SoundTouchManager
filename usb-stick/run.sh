# run.sh v2: the NAND cache is the source of truth.
#
# Changed compared to v1 (2026-05-15):
#   - The stick binary on the SD card is NOT automatically copied to NAND.
#     This keeps manually deployed NAND updates from disappearing on reboot.
#   - The stick binary is only used as a FALLBACK when NAND is empty.
#   - Manual stick->NAND sync: touch /mnt/nv/stmanager/sync-from-stick
#     Then it syncs from the stick on the next boot.
#
# Install on the box: scp setup/run.sh stbox:/media/sda1/run.sh

# /addWirelessProfile set the active profile yet the box would not associate;

# it only POSTs where a goform server actually answers, so on an sm2 box with
# no :80 coprocessor the probe finds nothing and it no-ops; and it configures
# a profile without tearing down a working ethernet link. Cheap (a couple of

# wifi_failover_seed SSID PASS IS_TAIGAN
# Non-destructive Wi-Fi failover seed for a box that is ONLINE without any
# stored Wi-Fi profile - the LAN-cable-only box (live case 2026-08-18, scm
# ST20: set up over ethernet, TAP `network wifi profiles info` answered an
# empty <WiFiProfiles />, and pulling the cable left the box with nothing to
# fall back to, blinking orange). The hands-off replay boot used to end
# without ever giving such a box its Wi-Fi, even though NAND wlan-creds hold
# the user's network; the M0a-prelease failover seed (same two steps, live
# verified on the scm ST30 2026-07-09) only fires on app-apply or fresh-stick
# boots, never on the everyday replay boot.
#
# Strictly gated on POSITIVE evidence that the box holds no Wi-Fi profile at
# all: an empty profile store is simultaneously the proof that the current
# lease is the cable (a box associated to Wi-Fi cannot have zero profiles) and
# the proof that there is nothing to disturb. Silence from every probe means
# hands off (the v0.9.7 rule stays intact for every provisioned box). The two
# writes are the proven non-destructive pair: /addWirelessProfile (NetManager
# DB entry; skipped on taigan where it silently fails) + goform_wlan_push
# (programs the SMSC/JukeBlox coprocessor; no-ops where no :80 handler
# answers). No teardown, no reboot, the working ethernet is untouched; the box
# merely gains a network to fail over to when the cable goes. Post-state is
# logged so the next diagnostic bundle proves whether the seed LANDED on this

#   1. lang.conf the desktop app wrote from the user's UI locale (it
#      carries the resolved sysLanguage int directly),
#   2. the value persisted to NAND on a previous boot,
#   3. derived from the region country code (region.conf / NAND),
#   4. English (3) as the neutral worldwide default.
# Full enum 1..25 in project_bose_language_enum (0 and 14 are invalid).
# Defined at top level so it is in scope inside the provisioning
# subshell AND the OOB-finalize path (see the sibling-subshell scope
# trap that bit current_sta_lease).

# Unconditional Stick -> NAND sync. Every boot with a stick present
# copies the stick binary AND the stick version.txt to NAND, no
# version check, no mtime guard.
#
# Why brute force: the previous version-string + mtime gated logic
# silently refused to sync in several scenarios:
#   - identical version strings across two different builds (e.g.
#     v0.5.12 + dev iterations both stamped v0.5.12)
#   - box RTC at 2015 on cold boot while FAT32 stick mtimes are at
#     real time, so the `-nt` mtime comparison flipped both ways
#     depending on whether NTP sync had run yet
#   - partial-sync recovery: SYNC_FLAG could be cleared by an earlier
#     half-failed copy, leaving NAND binary mid-state until next mismatch
#
# Result was that the Setup Wizard "prepare stick" felt broken from
# the user's perspective even though the stick had the right files.
# Live-verified 2026-05-24 on ST10 .66 across three back-to-back
# cold boots with a freshly-prepared stick.
#
# The fail-closed "stick wins, every time" model matches the user
# mental model: "what I just put on the stick is what the box runs
# on the next boot, period." The CACHED_BIN.new + mv atomic-replace
# pattern keeps the binary swap safe under power loss mid-copy.
# Removing SYNC_FLAG removes the only state that could go out of
# sync with reality across boots.
# cleanup_nand frees space on the small persistent_volume (~31 MB, shared
# with the Bose firmware). It removes known leftovers from earlier
# experiments/debug and caps the agent log so a long-running box does not
# slowly fill NAND. Runs on every boot BEFORE the stick -> NAND binary cache,
# so the cache always has room. All best-effort: a read-only or absent path is

#   1. Let Bose's init start the ORIGINAL SoftwareUpdate.
#   2. Wait for the mesh to fully stabilize — Bose /info on :8090
#      returning valid <info ...> for at least 30 s steady.
#   3. NOW set up the bind-mount.
#   4. SIGTERM the original SU.
#   5. nohup-relaunch via /opt/Bose/SoftwareUpdate (now bind-mounted).
#      The wrapper exec's SoftwareUpdate-real with LD_PRELOAD. The
#      new SU has the shim active and the mesh — already stable —

# It used to be opt-out. Both functions below named taigan, spotty, rhino and
# mojo, skipped those, and let every other box fall through into the bind-mount
# that replaces /opt/Bose/SoftwareUpdate and kills the running one. What that
# does where it is not wanted is on the record: a taigan boots with its light
# bar stuck and no setup AP, a spotty's BoseApp never answers within 180s (both
# live 2026-05-31), and on mojo the .so cannot even load (live ST30 2026-06-10,
#). The REDIRECT comment further down puts it plainly: the shim is
# boot-hang-prone on uncatalogued boxes.
#
# A box whose /proc/variant will not read, or whose codename nobody here has
# catalogued, is the box we know least about, and the deny-list handed exactly
# that box the most invasive path in this file. Every chassis in the catalogue
# was already skipping, so the hijack only ever ran where it had never been
# tried.
#
# Nothing loses reachability by this. A chipset-blocked chassis is reached
# through the iptables PREROUTING REDIRECT below, which leaves every Bose
# process alone, and REDIRECT_ELIGIBLE is deliberately wider than this gate
# ever was.
#
# STM_FORCE_SHIM_TAIGAN=1 turns it on for a hardware session. STM_SHIM_VARIANTS
# is a space-separated list of variant or hostname fragments it may run on, for
# the day a chassis turns up that genuinely needs it.

# The stick-side update.sh hook was removed in v0.9.28: it pulled a binary
# from GitHub Releases at boot with no checksum or attestation check, which
# is a second, unauthenticated update channel next to the app's OTA (and it
# bypassed the shared app/agent version stamp). Agent updates come from the
# desktop app only.

# === Wi-Fi provisioning from wlan.conf on the stick (multi-approach) ===
#
# A factory-reset Bose writes /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf on boot from
# its own NetManager DB. If no profile is stored there, it throws out
# our direct-write variant again on the next boot. So we run BOTH
# paths in parallel:
#
#   A) Direct write to /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf + wpa_supplicant
#      restart. Takes effect immediately, the box is on Wi-Fi within seconds.
#   B) addWirelessProfile API call against 127.0.0.1:8090. Persists
#      the profile in NetManager's own DB, so it survives the next
#      reboot without us having to read wlan.conf again.
#
# Whichever succeeds first wins. Every step is written to
# /media/sda1/setup.log with a timestamp so a user can simply pull
# the stick and upload the diagnostic log via the app (Bose's factory
# reset wipes NAND, the stick stays untouched).
# NAND-persisted credentials cache: once one of the WLAN provisioning
# approaches actually succeeded on a previous boot, we wrote the
# SSID+pass into $PERSIST/wlan-creds so subsequent boots can replay
# wpa_cli even though Bose's NetManager forgot the profile. Without
# this every reboot drops the box back to yellow because NetManager
# does not persist a wpa_cli-added network into its own DB.

# persist_wlan_creds writes the live SSID+PASS into NAND so a future
# reboot can replay via the elif branch above when the stick has been
# yanked and NetManager's own profile DB is stale or wiped. Idempotent —
# safe to call from every winner branch and from a single post-summary
# call site. Skips silently when SSID/PASS are empty (ethernet-only or
# WLAN-creds-not-loaded paths).
#
# 2026-05-30 — a rhino ST10 diagnostic bundle proved how badly the
# previous scheme failed: three boots in a row M1-http won with the
# stick's credentials, but M1 had no inline persist, so wlan-creds
# stayed whatever it was before. Then a True Factory Reset wiped
# wlan-creds AND Bose's NetworkProfiles.xml AND stick wlan.conf had
# already been removed by the previous "rm \$WLAN_CONF" line — every
# credential channel was empty on the next boot, and the box dropped
# straight into Setup-AP. Centralising persistence here means every
# M-winner benefits without per-branch boilerplate.

# assert_profile_priority makes the JUST-PROVISIONED network the one the
# firmware prefers, in NetManager's own store.: a deliberate switch left
# the OLD profile at priority="1" while the new one landed at "0" (NetManager
# adds at 0), so the box silently rejoined the old network on the next boot.
# The reporter proved the end state on his own box: chosen high, others zero.
# Runs ONLY in a provisioning run's winner path, right after persist_wlan_creds,
# never on an ordinary boot, so a network change made elsewhere later is not
# fought. The agent applies the same ranking on a runtime switch; this covers
# the first switch to a never-stored network, whose profile only exists in the
# store AFTER NetManager processed the add in this very run.
#
# awk with RS=">", not sed: the profile tags in the field file span several
# lines (the report shows the attributes on separate lines), and record-
# splitting on the tag terminator makes each tag one record regardless of its
# line layout. Everything outside the matched priority attribute is passed
# through byte for byte; the store's AES ciphertext attributes must survive
# untouched. The SSID comparison is literal (index, not regex) so metacharacters
# in a network name cannot derail it, and the attribute NAME is matched in
# either case while the value must match exactly.

# Wireless-interface detection. Two real cases on SoundTouch hardware

#      /sys/class/net/wlan0 (sometimes wlan1) with full wpa_supplicant
#      + wpa_cli userland: rhino (ST10), some sm2/scm ST20 builds, etc.
#
#   2. BCO-stack variants where the Wi-Fi chip is enumerated as
#      /sys/class/net/eth0 (no wlan* iface at all) and wpa_supplicant /
#      wpa_cli binaries are missing. NetManager talks to the chip via

#      /addWirelessProfile + /performWirelessSiteSurvey endpoints are

#      Confirmed BCO codenames so far: `taigan` (Portable), `spotty`

# points the Bose SDK's cloud URLs at the placeholder host stm-setup.invalid to
# fire an SSH injection, then restores them. If STM was installed via a path
# that skipped that restore, /mnt/nv/OverrideSdkPrivateCfg.xml still carries
# bmxRegistryUrl=https://stm-setup.invalid, which NXDOMAINs, so the box can
# never reach the SoundTouch service registry and its light bar sweeps forever
# (live ST300 2026-07-07). Rewrite the placeholder inside the bmx/stats/marge
# tags back to the STOCK hostnames: STM only redirects the stock hosts
# (streaming.bose.com, content.api.bose.io) via the /etc/hosts bind mount above,
# so the box MUST carry the stock hostnames for that redirect to catch them.
# Best-effort + idempotent: the grep gate means a config whose tags are all
# stock (or empty) is left untouched entirely. The SDK already read the (bad)
# value earlier this boot, so this heal takes effect on the following boot;
# install.sh does the same before the post-install reboot so the very first

# === iptables INPUT ACCEPT for our listener ports ===
#
# Series-I SoundTouch (SMSC/SCM components, no wlan0 interface) ships
# a Bose stock firewall that REJECTs every TCP port outside a small
# whitelist (8080/8090/8091/80/443). STM's :8888 / :9080 / :8081 /
# :8443 listeners bind fine and `netstat -ltn` shows LISTEN, but every
# inbound SYN from a desktop client gets RST'd at the INPUT chain.
# `nc -vz <lan-ip> 8888` returns RST while `nc -vz <lan-ip>
# 8091` succeeds on an affected Series-I ST20, and the desktop's
# diagnostic-bundle field `reachable8888=false` co-occurs with a
# healthy agent bootstrap on the same bundle.
#
# Insert ACCEPT rules at position 1 of the INPUT chain so they win
# over the Bose firmware's DROP/REJECT entries. The stmanager-fw
# marker lets us identify the rules later for clean removal.
#
# Two complications observed live on ST10 .66 v0.5.13 setup.log:
#
#   1. The filter table is NOT loaded yet at uptime ~22 s when our
#      run.sh block first runs. Bose's `/etc/init.d/Firewalls/
#      update_iptables` script (PID seen alive in the post-start
#      snapshot) does the modprobe + chain build later in boot. Our
#      first iptables -I INPUT calls returned non-zero and logged
#      "FAILED (filter table missing?)" — Series-II boxes still work
#      because Bose's eventual rule accepts all LAN traffic, but
#      Series-I boxes silently kept rejecting :8888 because we never
#      retried.
#
#   2. Bose's Firewall script may re-build the chain later (init or
#      periodic), flushing our rules. A one-shot install is therefore
#      not enough.
#
# Solution: do the install in a background subshell that waits up to
# 60 s for the filter table to appear, installs, then re-asserts the
# rules every 30 s for the lifetime of run.sh. iptables -C is the
# idempotency guard: it returns 0 if the rule already exists, so a
# re-assert is cheap and writes nothing when nothing changed.

# STM_FW_COMMENT reports which form the last successful insert used, "yes" or
# "no", empty until one has run. It is a REPORT, never a decision: nothing
# reads it to choose a form.
#
# Why this exists: NOT ONE rhino chain in the evidence set carried a
# single stmanager-fw rule, on any box, including one that had been up fifty
# hours and was working fine. Either every insert fails silently (a kernel
# built without xt_comment refuses the whole rule, and the 2>/dev/null hid
# it), or the block never runs. Both were invisible, because the only log
# lines here were the successes.
#
# So: try the commented form, fall back to the bare one, and say which took.
# A log line and a fallback, not a new behaviour.
#
# What it must NOT do is latch. An earlier version set it to "no" whenever a
# commented insert failed for ANY reason, xtables lock contention included, and
# fw_have then stopped looking for the commented form: the already-installed
# commented rules went invisible on the next 30 s pass and each got a second,

# === Chipset-whitelist hijack via LD_PRELOAD on SoftwareUpdate ===
#
# On Series-I boxes (moduleType=scm, codenames taigan/spotty) the
# BCO wifi chipset firmware drops inbound external TCP to STM's
# :8888 / :9080 / :8081 at the chipset level, regardless of iptables
# state. The only externally-reachable ports are those bound by
# specific Bose binaries (libProtobufMessagingIPC magic). Verified
# live 2026-05-28 on the Portable.
#
# Fix on Series-I: keep Bose's SoftwareUpdate binary as the listener
# on :17008 (chipset stays happy) but launch it under LD_PRELOAD of
# our stm-shim.so, which hooks accept() and forwards every inbound
# connection to 127.0.0.1:8888 (STM webui). SoftwareUpdate has no
# remaining purpose post-cloud-shutdown so hijacking it costs
# nothing functional.
#
# On Series-II boxes (moduleType=sm2, codenames rhino/maple/etc.)
# the chipset is permissive — STM's own :8888 is directly reachable
# from outside. The shim would hijack :17008 which is closed there
# anyway. Hijack runs only when IS_SERIES_ONE is detected.
#
# Stick-to-NAND sync of the .so happens here so a stickless boot can
# still re-hijack via the NAND copy. Watchdog re-asserts every 30 s
# in case shepherdd respawns SoftwareUpdate without our env.
# sync_shim_to_nand is defined once near the top of this script (early
# shim-stage block); we only re-invoke it here. It used to be defined a
# SECOND time at this spot, an exact-duplicate definition the shell
# linter flagged (SC2218) that served no purpose, so it was removed; the
# single top-level definition covers both call sites.
sync_shim_to_nand

# === Bind-mount wrapper: hijack /opt/Bose/SoftwareUpdate non-destructively ===
#
# Previous attempt killed SoftwareUpdate AFTER Bose's init had
# already registered it in the internal IPC mesh, then re-launched
# under LD_PRELOAD. Result on Series-I: BoseApp /info returns 500
# until full power-cycle reboot. The mesh has no graceful re-
# registration path.
#
# Better: bind-mount a small wrapper script over Bose's binary path
# BEFORE Bose's init runs SoftwareUpdate. Bose's init then exec's
# /opt/Bose/SoftwareUpdate, the kernel sees `#!/bin/sh` on the
# wrapper (RAM-overlaid via mount --bind), runs the wrapper which
# in turn exec's the real binary with LD_PRELOAD set. The very
# first SoftwareUpdate process in the mesh has the shim active,
# accept() on :17008 is hijacked, no kill, no mesh disruption.
#
# Disable knob: `touch $PERSIST/state/shim-disable` to suppress the
# bind-mount + late swap on the next boot.

# Series-I detection. Live-verified pattern: moduleType=scm in
# Bose's /info OR variant codename in {taigan, spotty} → Series-I,
# chipset whitelist blocks STM's :8888 / :9080 / :8081 externally,
# shim hijack on SoftwareUpdate :17008 is required. Everything else
# (sm2, rhino, maple, ...) is Series-II with a permissive chipset
# that lets external clients hit STM's own listeners directly; the
# shim would only block :17008 on those without offering any new
# reachability, so we skip it.
#
# The matching table is fed by user diagnostic bundles. Known
# entries 2026-05-28:
#   scm + taigan     → Portable          → Series-I → shim ON
#   scm + spotty     → ST20 (rev A) → Series-I → shim ON

# Eligibility for the iptables PREROUTING REDIRECT path (external :8888

# catalogues by codename/moduleType. detect_series_one stays narrow on
# purpose (it ALSO gates the boot-hang-prone LD_PRELOAD shim, which must
# NOT run on an uncatalogued BCO box); the REDIRECT is harmless on any
# box (no-op where the chipset is permissive), so we widen it to include
# every BCO_MODE box: taigan, spotty, scm, has-bco, AND the structural
# eth0-only fallback for models not yet catalogued. Without this a
# fallback-detected BCO model provisions Wi-Fi via M_air but stays
# externally unreachable, so the desktop app never sees it as STM.
# Chipset-whitelist detection beyond detect_series_one's narrow codename/
# moduleType match. Some chassis report moduleType=sm2 yet carry the older
# SMSC2014 USB-Ethernet bridge (a SECOND networkInfo entry, type="SMSC") whose
# chipset whitelists only Bose-binary-bound listeners, so STM's :8888 is NOT
# externally reachable even though moduleType=sm2 and a wlan0 interface exists
# (so neither IS_SERIES_ONE nor BCO_MODE fired). Live 2026-06-17: a SoundTouch 10
# with moduleType=sm2 / variant=rhino but an SMSC networkInfo entry; the agent
# bound :8888 fine, yet the box's own self-probe to its LAN IP failed and the
# desktop app could not reach it. The "SMSC" marker (absent on a plain permissive
# sm2 box) is the discriminator; the universal SCM *component* is not. Widen
# REDIRECT_ELIGIBLE so the harmless, additive :17008 -> :8888 REDIRECT is
# installed (same-port REDIRECTs are no-ops on a permissive chipset, and the
# :17008 rule matches no traffic where :17008 is closed). This deliberately does
# NOT widen IS_SERIES_ONE: the LD_PRELOAD shim is boot-hang-prone on uncatalogued
# boxes and must stay gated on the narrow codename/moduleType match.

# ============================================================
# Cheap experiment (Series-I:8888 unreachable from LAN)
# ============================================================
# Hypothesis from a 2026-05-29 comment: the scm chipset routes
# external TCP differently than internal. Self-connect to
# LAN_IP:8888 from the box itself works (proven by every spotty
# setup.log dump), but external clients on the same LAN get
# refused even though the listener is bound to 0.0.0.0:8888 and
# iptables INPUT ACCEPT is in place. That points at a chipset
# whitelist that filters by process identity rather than the
# kernel-level firewall.
#
# Cheap test path BEFORE the heavier LD_PRELOAD bind-mount shim:
# install an iptables PREROUTING REDIRECT rule for STM's listener
# ports. Inbound traffic to <LAN_IP>:PORT gets rewritten to
# 127.0.0.1:PORT before the chipset filter sees the destination,
# and STM's loopback listener accepts it.
#
#   - If the chipset filter is at the routing/socket-owner layer
#     (after iptables PREROUTING), REDIRECT bypasses it and the
#     port becomes externally reachable. WIN.
#   - If the chipset filter is in NIC hardware (before iptables),
#     REDIRECT does nothing and the box stays unreachable.
#     Still safe: PREROUTING rules are no-ops on traffic that
#     never arrives.
#
# Restricted to Series-I only because Series-II boxes already get
# external reachability via the normal listener bind. Repeats
# every 30 s same as the INPUT ACCEPT install.

# operation without a dirty FS (then Windows does not need to repair
# the FAT).
#
# SSH is deliberately NOT stopped — pre-1.0 we leave the channel
# open so the desktop app can pull its diagnostic bundle even with
# a broken agent (see ensure_sshd_running at the start of run.sh).
# The earlier logic explicitly stopped sshd here as soon as the
# agent was reachable on :8888, which closed the path to the logs
# on every later crash.
#
# Debug opt-out: if /media/sda1/keep-open exists, skip the entire
# cleanup so the stick stays mounted. Used during interactive
# debugging when we want to read live /media/sda1 state without
# rebooting the box. Removed by deleting the file (e.g. del
# E:\keep-open from Jens' laptop) — next boot returns to normal
