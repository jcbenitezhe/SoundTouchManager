# bmxRegistryUrl=https://stm-setup.invalid, which NXDOMAINs, so the box can NEVER
# reach the SoundTouch service registry and its light bar sweeps forever (live

# for the redirect to catch them. Run this before the post-install reboot so the
# SDK reads healed URLs on its very next boot. Idempotent: a fully stock (or
