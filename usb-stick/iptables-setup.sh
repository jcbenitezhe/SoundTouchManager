# iptables-setup.sh: sets PREROUTING rules so Bose box traffic on
# 80 and 443 goes to our local agent ports.
#
# Called by run.sh after the agent starts, removed again on stop.
#
# Usage:
#   sh iptables-setup.sh install   # set the rules
#   sh iptables-setup.sh remove    # remove the rules
#   sh iptables-setup.sh status    # show active rules
#
# The rules carry a unique marker in the comment so they can be
# removed safely without affecting other rules.

# INPUT_ACCEPT_PORTS list the agent ports that must be reachable from
# the LAN. On Series-I SoundTouch (older ST20 / ST10 variants with the
# SMSC-2014 + SCM components and no wlan0 interface) the Bose stock
# firmware installs an INPUT chain that REJECTs everything outside a
# tiny whitelist (8090, 8091, 8080 ...). The Go listener on :8888
# binds fine and `netstat -ltn` shows it LISTEN, but every connect
# attempt from a desktop client gets "connection refused" (TCP RST
# from the firewall).: `nc -vz 192.0.2.66 8888` fails while
# `nc -vz 192.0.2.66 8091` works on an affected Series-I ST20.
# Fix: insert ACCEPT rules at the TOP of the INPUT chain so the box
# answers our ports before reaching the Bose DROP rule. On later
# (Series-II) boxes without that INPUT chain the rules are harmless.
