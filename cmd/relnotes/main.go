// Command relnotes generates human-facing release notes from the
// Conventional Commit subjects between two git refs.
//
// It is run by the release workflow to produce two artifacts:
//
//   - a Markdown "What's changed" block, inserted at the top of the
//     GitHub Release body, and
//   - a JSON object ({"markdown": ..., "items": [...]}) merged into
//     manifest.json as the "notes" field, so the website and the
//     desktop app can show the same change list without scraping the
//     Releases UI.
//
// Only user-facing commit types are kept (feat, fix, perf) plus any
// commit flagged breaking (a "!" before the colon). Noise like chore,
// ci, build, test, style, refactor, and docs is dropped, so a user
// reading the notes sees only what tells them whether the upgrade is
// worth it.
//
// It is intentionally dependency-free (standard library + the git CLI)
// to stay inside the project's supply-chain posture: no new third-party
// action or module in the release path.
