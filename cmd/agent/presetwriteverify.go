// Telling a preset write that landed from one the box merely accepted.

// The Bose CLI answers an AddPreset it will not honour exactly as it answers one
// it will, and then stores nothing. The reconcile used to read that answer as
// success and log "preset reconcile healed" per slot, so a speaker with four
// dead hardware keys produced four lines saying the keys had just been repaired.
//
// Measured on a SoundTouch 20 on 2026-09-27: its write ledger reads
// addpreset@INVALID_SOURCE eight times over, the firmware refused every write,
// and the log carried nothing but healed slots. A diagnostic that asserts the
// opposite of the truth is worse than one that says nothing, because it sends
// whoever reads it somewhere else entirely, and that is what it did.
//
// The native form already had a readback of its own (verifyNativeWrites, which
// also re-writes what it finds missing). The UPnP form had none at all, which is
// the form a speaker falls back to precisely when it is having trouble. So this
// covers both and claims nothing before it has looked.

// When the box cannot be read at all, every slot is reported as landed. That is
// deliberate: the alternative is to call a write failed on the strength of a
// failed GET, which would put the reconcile into its fast retry cadence over a
// momentary blip and rewrite presets nobody asked it to touch. No evidence of
// loss is not evidence of loss.
