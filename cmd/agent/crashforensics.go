// Crash forensics: why the previous agent process stopped.
//
// The agent can vanish and be respawned by the boot script's watchdog without
// leaving a single line about it. A live Portable did exactly that on
// 2026-08-14: a healthy Spotify session (156 s attached, 3049 KB forwarded),
// then nothing for 76 seconds, then "stmanager starting" with
// bootReason="agent-respawn (box already up 2h19m)". Spotify never recovered
// afterwards, and the log could not say whether the process had panicked, been
// killed for memory, or been stopped deliberately.
//
// One thing it could already say by omission: a deliberate stop logs "shutdown
// signal received" from the SIGTERM handler, and there was no such line. So the
// process was killed rather than asked to stop. That is inference from an
// absence, which is exactly the kind of reasoning this file exists to replace.
//
// Two cheap measurements make the next one answerable:
//
//   - A heartbeat in /tmp, so the next start knows what the previous run looked
//     like moments before it died: free memory, the agent's own footprint,
//     thread count and whether Spotify was streaming. /tmp is tmpfs, so it
//     costs no NAND and it survives an agent respawn while a box reboot clears
//     it, which is the same distinction bootReason draws.
//   - The kernel's own verdict. The OOM killer names its victim in the ring
//     buffer, and that line settles "killed for memory" outright.
