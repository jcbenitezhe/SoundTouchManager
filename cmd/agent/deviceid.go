// correctDeviceIDFromBox replaces the MAC-derived startup guess with the id the
// speaker reports for itself in GET /info.
//
// Why this exists: the agent's startup value comes from a network interface
// MAC, and a speaker with two interfaces uses only one of them as its identity.
// Measured on an ST10, /info carries deviceID="94E36DF9CE40" (its SCM
// interface) while the agent had guessed "10CEA9E8CF31" (its SMSC interface).
// The id lands in the <devices> block of the emulated account, and the firmware
// throws away an account whose device list does not contain itself - together
// with the <sources> block in it, which is what registers the radio source that
// the hardware preset keys need. So a wrong id here reads, on the speaker, as
// "the preset buttons stopped working after a reboot".
//
// Read-only and bounded: it polls /info until the firmware answers (it is still
// booting for the first minute or so), then stops. It never writes to the box,
// so it cannot affect the standby countdown, and it gives up quietly rather
// than retrying forever if the box never answers - in which case the old
// guessed value simply remains in place, exactly as before.
