// Wake signal from two origins. The gabbo bus reports a standby entry and a
// standby exit as source changes, and cmd/agent acts on them through
// OnEnterStandby / OnStandbyExit. Some chassis never send the power frame,
// and the source change is lost while the WebSocket is between its idle
// recycles, so the same two transitions are also read from the firmware's
// syslog ring (internal/boxlog, PowerEvent). Both origins describe the same
// physical moment and must reach the handler once: whichever arrives first
// is delivered, the other one inside powerSignalWindow is a duplicate. The
// handler's actions are unchanged, only the door they come through is.
//
// What a syslog transition is mapped to, deliberately:
//   - wake -> OnStandbyExit. The HSM line is the system controller leaving
//     Standby, which is exactly what the STANDBY -> X source change means.
//     OnPowerWake is NOT fired from the ring: on the bus it additionally
//     says the box restored one of STM's own selections it cannot play
//     (DO_NOT_RESUME), which the ring cannot tell, and ResumeLastPlay on a
//     box that woke to Bluetooth or AUX would start a stream the bus never
//     would have.
//   - standby -> OnEnterStandby, under the dispatcher's own gate (STM's
//     UPnP source was the active one, boxws.Client.UPnPActiveRecently), so a
//     power-off of AUX or a native station is left alone exactly as before.
//
// The standby door is NOT first-come while the bus is live. The standby
// handler (webui.HandleEnterStandby) tells a user power-off from the firmware
// dropping the source on its own by the age of the last user key, and the
// fresh stamp for a power press arrives on the bus (userActivityUpdate) in
// the same moment as the bus's own standby frame. The HSM line can be read
// from the ring before that frame lands; acting on it then classifies a
// deliberate power-off against a stale stamp, takes the spontaneous-drop
// branch (no stop latch, no transport clear, possibly a re-push that
// switches the box back on) and the bus frame that carried the right answer
// is dropped as the duplicate. So while the socket is up the ring's standby
// is held for standbyHoldForBus (a one-shot timer, no polling): a bus
// delivery cancels it, a wake supersedes it, and only when the bus stays
// silent does the ring's report go through the door. With the socket down
// the ring delivers at once, as nothing else will.

// powerSignalWindow is how long after one origin delivered a transition the
// other origin's report of it counts as a duplicate. The bus frame and the
// HSM line are within about a second of each other; five seconds covers a
// loaded box and is still far shorter than any deliberate off/on.

// bus's own report while the socket is up. A var so tests can shorten it.
