// Holding a preset key down while THAT key's own Spotify playlist is playing
// used to destroy the preset.
//
// The speaker's station descriptor names the stream it is fetching, which for a
// Spotify preset is the agent's own per-slot Ogg proxy. That URL was not
// recognised as one of STM's keys, so it fell through as if it were a station
// origin, and the slot was rewritten as a radio preset whose stream URL was the
// proxy: the playlist URI gone, the type wrong, and a "station" that only
// resolves while that slot happens to be playing Spotify. A reporter's bundle
// (2026-09-09) carried exactly that damage on two of three speakers, slots 3
// and 4 as type=radio pointing at .../spotify/stream-N.ogg, against a third box
// whose slot 4 was still a proper spotify preset.
//
// The right answer for a key held down while its own content plays is "nothing
// changes".
