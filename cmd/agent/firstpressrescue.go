// The first press after a rest, and why it used to produce silence.
//
// Measured on an ST30 on 2026-09-27, from the owner's own speaker. The box was
// in standby. One press of key 2 arrived, and within a second and a half the
// firmware did all of this:
//
//	09:02:05.011  the box announced its PREVIOUS content item, a Spotify key
//	09:02:05.639  1036 UNABLE_TO_PROCESS_NOT_LOGGED_IN, UpnpRcvdContentItemInWrongState
//	09:02:06.226  the speaker left standby
//	09:02:06.590  it opened the stream and dropped it 2 ms later
//	09:02:07.298  Decoder: "Could not obtain first-frame 1"
//	09:02:07.314  APAudioControl: PlaybackFailure ERROR_NO_DECODED_DATA
//	09:02:07.355  the owner pressed the key a second time
//
// Nothing here is STM's doing: the station resolved, the proxy served, the key
// was registered. The box simply woke into the wrong state, asked for the
// stream before its audio path was ready, and threw the first fetch away. What
// IS STM's doing is that it watched this happen and did nothing, because the
// firmware's own failure lines were classified for the diagnostic bundle and
// delivered to no one.
//
// So the second press becomes the agent's job. One retry, only just after a
// native preset activation, only once per activation, and only when the
// speaker is not already playing something by the time the retry would fire.
