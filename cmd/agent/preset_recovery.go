// The preset store recovery's verdict, the empty-store prune and the seams
// they share with the reconcile.
//
// Field case (three SoundTouch 10s): STM was removed from one speaker
// and reinstalled. The removal deleted the STM folder on the speaker, and
// with it the preset store; the reinstall started empty. The firmware kept
// the six native keys the old install had registered, so the desktop drew
// six playable stations on a speaker whose store had nothing, the phone
// remote (which reads the store) showed six empty keys, and the reporter
// concluded the remote had failed to sync. Nothing in the agent noticed:
// the store recovery and the prune matched only the absolute proxy form of
// a key, not the relative native form the speaker reports, and an empty
// store made the reconcile return before reading the box at all.

// prunes the STM-origin slots and reports the box as done, so the loop drops

// entered on an empty store and then read the box would see the six keys the
// restore had just registered, all in STM's own form, and against the empty
// store it entered on every one would be stale: six removals, six dead keys
// until the maintenance tick re-adds them, on the very reinstall flow the
// stash exists for, the first time the owner presses a key. So once the list
