// Field evidence, ST20 on v0.9.55, 2026-08-22 20:55: the user switched the box
// on, STM resumed his station over UPnP and it was playing (ICY titles at
// :27.5 and :29.4), then the power-wake re-sync wrote six slots at :32.4. The
// source flipped UPNP -> LOCAL_INTERNET_RADIO -> STANDBY within 290 ms and the
// music was gone after six seconds. STM's own forensics line names it:
// "the box changed source across a preset write, before=UPNP after=STANDBY".
//
// A hold, never a skip: the keys still have to end up registered, so the wait
// is bounded and the pass runs anyway once the ceiling passes.
//
// The FIRST full registration after the agent starts is never held. A
// just-started agent may find the box already playing, and holding there would
// leave the hardware keys unregistered for the whole session - the regression
// was about. everFullDone false means that first pass has not happened yet.
//
// Audio is not the only thing a write interrupts, which is what cost. A
// speaker in Bluetooth pairing mode reports playStatus INVALID, so the play
// test above says "not playing" and the hold waved the write through. That
// reporter's ledger reads addpreset@BLUETOOTH 3, and his box flipped
// BLUETOOTH -> LOCAL_INTERNET_RADIO -> BLUETOOTH four times inside six seconds
