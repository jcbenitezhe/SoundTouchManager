// Post-switch network state refresh.
//
// A live Wi-Fi switch (the wpaConfirmed arm in internal/webui/wlan.go, and the
// boot guard's finishCorrection) can land the box on a NEW address, and until
// v0.9.57 nothing derived from the old one was ever told: the mDNS host
// responder and the service announcer kept answering with the boot address,
// the peer roster then re-adopted that stale self-announcement as a peer and
// dialed the dead address every sweep, and the per-IP REDIRECT rules from
// run.sh piled up for both addresses. Only a cold boot healed all three
// (field report, ST20 moved 192.168.178.x -> 10.10.50.x live).
//
// The refresh is self-computing: everything stale is recognisable as "carries
// our identity or our rule shape, but not one of our CURRENT addresses", so no
// pre-switch snapshot has to survive the switch.
