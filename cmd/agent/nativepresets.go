// Native presets: storing a slot as a LOCAL_INTERNET_RADIO station rather than
// a UPnP stream, so the speaker can activate its own hardware key.
//
// Measured on an ST10 (FW 27.0.6, 2026-08-02): a UPNP preset makes the box
// answer its OWN key press with 1036 UNABLE_TO_PROCESS_NOT_LOGGED_IN /
// UpnpRcvdContentItemInWrongState, then flap UPNP -> INVALID_SOURCE -> UPNP,
// and only STM's recovery (clear the transport, push again, verify) gets audio
// out, about eight seconds after the press. The same station stored as a
// native radio item plays in about two seconds and logs nothing, because the
// firmware accepts it.
//
// The cause is not a login. UPNP is the box's local MediaRenderer and reports
// status="UNAVAILABLE" in GET /sources even WHILE it is the actively playing
// source, so the firmware's availability check can never pass. Registering
// UPNP in the emulated account does not change that (tried, no effect) and is
// actively wrong: it is a device-local slot the firmware answers with
// INVALID_SOURCE.
//
// Every preset STM stores is already an HTTP URL on our own stream proxy -
// radio, playlist queues and Spotify alike - so the conversion is uniform and
// needs no per-type handling: the same URL simply travels inside an orion
// station descriptor instead of a UPnP ContentItem.
//
// This migrates the installed base without asking anything of anyone: the next
// preset sync after an agent update rewrites the slots in place. It is gated on
// the box actually reporting the radio source as registered, and falls back to
// the UPnP form otherwise, so a speaker where the emulated account did not take
// keeps exactly the behaviour it has today.
