// One speaker, one write at a time.
//
// Nothing stopped two installs or updates running against the same speaker at
// once, and a donor's SoundTouch 20 showed what that costs (2026-08-11). His
// update journal carries every line twice, one second apart, and the speaker's
// own log shows the consequence plainly:
//
//	17:30:46 upload started endpoint=agent-update contentLength=13303970 remote=...:50042
//	17:30:48 upload started endpoint=agent-update contentLength=13303970 remote=...:50043
//
// Two 13 MB uploads into a box with 122 MB of RAM, both writing the same
// stmanager-armv7l.new. One of them renamed the file into place, the other then
// failed with "rename ...new: no such file or directory" - the 500 that made
// the install look broken. Each landing upload also makes the agent apply and
// reboot, so the speaker went away twice and stayed away for twenty minutes,
// long past the window the app was willing to wait.
//
// None of the downstream repairs (retrying the upload, waiting longer, being
// gentler about a missing engine) address that. This does: the second run is
// refused with a plain answer while the first is still working.
// errBoxBusyToken marks the refusal as "your second start was turned away",
// as opposed to "the update failed". The window needs to tell those apart
// without matching the prose: on 2026-09-14 a second Update click on a
// SoundTouch 30 was correctly refused here, and the app showed the owner a
// full failure report with a copyable error for an update that was running
// perfectly and finished a minute later.
