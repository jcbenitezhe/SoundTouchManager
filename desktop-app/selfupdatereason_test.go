// /Applications/SoundTouch Manager.app in place without asking. Four conditions can
// produce the first outcome and the app recorded none of them, so three days of
// thread went on guesses about a machine neither of us can see, and I told them
// their Mac says no when their own log from that morning says yes.
//
// This pins the part that makes the next report answerable in one reading: the
// app always says where it runs from and, when it cannot update itself, which
// condition said no.
