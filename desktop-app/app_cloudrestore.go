// Putting STM back in charge of the speakers' cloud address, on every speaker
// at once.
//
// A SoundTouch speaker holds ONE address for the service it reports to. STM
// sets it, and so does every rival app; whoever wrote last owns the speaker.
// STM keeps the original hostname and points it at the speaker itself, so the
// traffic never leaves the house. Another app can instead write its own host on
// the internet, and then STM can no longer pair with the speaker and the six
// hardware keys go dead.
//
// Measured on a five-speaker fleet on 2026-09-26, minutes after the ST Remote
// Pro iOS app was started: every live margeURL had become
// stremotepro.com/api/bose-cloud, every speaker restarted, none was paired
// afterwards. The override file on NAND was untouched and still correct, which
// is why the existing file-based repair healed nothing.
//
// The cure is a restart: the firmware reads that file once, at boot. Verified
// on all five, one reboot each, every one back stock and paired.
