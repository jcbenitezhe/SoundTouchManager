// updateCertPool builds the TLS root pool for the update clients: the OS/system
// trust store first, then the embedded Mozilla bundle appended.
//
// Trusting the system store is what lets the update check work behind an
// HTTPS-inspecting security suite (Norton and friends): such a suite terminates
// TLS itself and re-presents a certificate signed by its OWN root CA, which it
// installs into the OS trust store but which is NOT in the embedded Mozilla
// bundle. Pinning to the embedded bundle alone failed the handshake with
// "certificate signed by unknown authority", so the check failed SILENTLY and no
// update banner ever appeared, even though the user's browser (which trusts the
// suite's CA via the OS store) saw the site fine. Seeding from the system store
// makes Go accept the interception cert exactly like the browser does. The
// embedded bundle is still appended as a belt-and-braces anchor for a sparse
// system store.
//
// The pool is ALWAYS non-nil, which preserves the fix: a nil RootCAs routes
// macOS verification through the cgo Security.framework path that crashed the app
// at startup; a non-nil pool keeps verification in Go's own chain builder. The
// downloaded binary is still SHA256-verified against the manifest, so trusting
// whoever terminates TLS never weakens the integrity of what gets installed.

// updateHTTPClient returns the http.Client used for the external update-check
// request, configured so its entire network path is pure Go with no cgo:
//
//   - DNS: net.DefaultResolver.PreferGo is set in main(), and we also pin a
//     PreferGo resolver on the dialer here, so name resolution never touches
//     the C getaddrinfo path.
//   - TLS cert verification: we supply an explicit RootCAs pool from the
//     embedded Mozilla bundle. This matters on macOS: with RootCAs left nil,
//     crypto/x509 verifies the server certificate against the system trust
//     store through cgo (Security.framework), which SIGSEGV'd on an old Mac
//     during the startup update check and took the whole app down before it
//     could draw a window (issue — kill-switch A/B confirmed the
//     crash is in this call). A non-nil RootCAs switches verification to Go's
//     own chain builder, removing the last cgo path.
//
// The rest of the app still links cgo for the WebKit webview; this only
// affects the one outbound HTTPS request. A dedicated client also keeps the
// shared httpClient (used for plain-HTTP box LAN calls) untouched.
