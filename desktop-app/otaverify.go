// Post-OTA verification memory: which agent port the update went through, and
// whether the verify window ended without a verdict.
//
// Two things went wrong on a SoundTouch 10 (rhino, sm2 chassis) on 2026-09-06.
// The update itself went through :8888, the box rebooted, its Wi-Fi came back
// late, and the verify window ran out. The journal then said the box was
// "unreachable" on :17008, a port that chassis DROPs in its own iptables INPUT
// chain, because boxDo reported whichever port it had tried LAST. Two minutes
// later discovery found the box on :8888 running the new build, and nothing
// wrote that down: the journal's last word on a successful update stayed
// "NOT CONFIRMED".
//
// So the update flow now remembers the port that worked, the version poll
// asks that port first on every pass, the transport error leads with that
// port (app_transport.go), and a discovery sighting of the box on the new
// build appends a corrective outcome line.
