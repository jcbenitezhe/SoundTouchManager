// build: `git describe` off an unchanged commit returns the same string every
// time, so a speaker that took the update looked identical to one that refused
// it, and every speaker burned its full deadline before being reported as a
// failure it was not (2026-07-29). It is also the honest check for a re-run,
// where a speaker is already on the target and nothing needs to move at all.
