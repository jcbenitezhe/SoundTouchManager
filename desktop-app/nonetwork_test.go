// A Wi-Fi outage on the USER'S machine, and the three wrong things STM did
// about it.
//
// Eileen Wilson pulled her Mac's Wi-Fi in the middle of a speaker update on
// 2026-09-10 and mailed in the log. What it shows, on all three of her speakers
// at once and on SSH port 22 as well, is ENETUNREACH: the operating system
// saying there is no route to that network, so nothing was ever put on the
// wire. What the app did with that:
//
//  1. blamed her firewall, or her speakers being on a different Wi-Fi,
//  2. waited out the full two-minute "let the speaker settle" window and then
//     escalated to the SSH path, which on a BCO chassis reboots the speaker to
//     open :17000,
//  3. finished by telling her to unplug a speaker that was never at fault.
//
// None of the three is defensible on an error that proves the request never
// left the machine. These tests pin that.
