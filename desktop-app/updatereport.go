// fact. Both halves of that had drifted apart: the report gathered exactly ONE
// new thing (a single /api/agent/version call) and printed the advice the user
// had just read on screen around it. A real one, mailed in 2026-08-23 for an
// install onto 192.168.1.34, read in full: six header lines, one "context
// deadline exceeded", and three sentences about firewalls. It could not
// distinguish a speaker that was off from one on a guest network from one that
// was answering on a port nobody asked about.
//
// So the report now states facts first and advises last:
//
//	what failed          the step's own words, advice stripped out
//	network facts        ICMP, ARP, every relevant port and what it answered
//	this PC              interfaces, subnets, firewall profiles
//	on the network       what discovery can currently see
//	speaker reports now  the speaker's own values, when it answers
//	what the update did  the OTA/install journal for this speaker
//	app log              the log lines about this speaker
//	what to try          every advice paragraph, collected at the end
//
// Only data the user is already entitled to see about their own equipment, in
// plain text, so they can read it before deciding to send it. Deliberately NOT
// anonymized (the real addresses are the point), with two exceptions that are
// nobody's business either way: the speaker's MAC is cut to its vendor prefix

// on THIS PC's subnet (it was discovered and shares the subnet) yet a ping to
// it, which no PC firewall can block, gets no answer. That is a Wi-Fi keeping
// its clients apart, not a firewall, and pointing at the firewall sent users
// chasing the wrong thing (Jens). Only fires on the not-reachable phase,
// i.e. when :22, :8090 and :8091 were all silent.

// speaker earlier in the SAME run: an SSH login or a staged install. A firewall,
// a wrong subnet or client isolation would all have blocked that, so any of
