package main

// The address that goes on the QR code for a speaker's phone remote.
//
// It used to be the speaker's IP, and an IP is exactly the thing that changes.
// A router hands out a new lease, the page the phone has on its home screen
// points at nothing, and the person who scanned that code weeks ago has no way
// of knowing why. Reported by Jens for several users on 2026-09-27.
//
// A name survives that, but only a name that is actually true. The FRITZ!Box in
// the reference network serves one per speaker and one of them comes back as
// "B--roPortable.fritz.box", which is the umlaut in the speaker's own name
// mangled twice over: it is served, it looks plausible, and nothing says whether
// it resolves. So no name goes on a QR code until it has been resolved back to
// the speaker's address AND the speaker has answered through it.
//
// Two candidates, in this order:
//
//  1. The name the ROUTER knows, from a reverse lookup. This is ordinary DNS,
//     so every phone on the network can resolve it, which is the whole point.
//  2. The name the SPEAKER answers for itself, stm-<id>.local, published by
//     internal/mdnshost. Reliable on iOS, patchy on Android, so it is the
//     fallback rather than the first choice.
//
// The IP is always reported alongside, because a phone with a private-DNS
// setting or on a guest network resolves neither, and there the IP is the only
// thing that works.
