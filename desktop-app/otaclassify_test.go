// The verdict the app writes into the journal after an update, and the verdict
// that decides whether it will ever offer that update again.
//
// v0.9.88 got this wrong for everybody. Its release workflow took the build
// stamp inside a three-leg matrix, so the desktop apps were stamped
// 2026-09-26-2023 while the ARM agent they embed and push carried
// 2026-09-26-2022: one minute apart, same commit. The classifier compared those
// stamps, so a perfectly successful update was journalled as
//
//	NOT CONFIRMED - the pushed binary IS on the box's disk but the running agent
//	is still v0.9.88 build 2026-09-26-2022; the update did not take effect
//	(boot rollback / swap failure), an identical re-push cannot help
//
// which is false in every clause, and it armed the loop breaker so the user was
// told to stop trying. Three of them wrote in on 2026-09-27, one with eleven
// speakers, all eleven on the new build reporting the identical agent hash.
//
// The opposite mistake is just as expensive and is the reason this is a matrix
// rather than one assertion: is a push that reaches the box's DISK and then
// does not boot. Confirming on the on-disk hash would report that as a success
// and disarm the loop breaker written to stop it repeating forever.
