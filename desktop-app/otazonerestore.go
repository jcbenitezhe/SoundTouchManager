// Field report, 2026-09-28 (five speakers): the user built a group of four at
// 09:31:58, STM started updating that very master 22 seconds later, and by the
// time the diagnostic was taken every box reported an empty zone with the three
// followers in standby. The master still listed them under "remembered", so STM
// knew exactly which speakers had just been taken out of the group and said
// nothing. From the user's chair: speakers added, speakers gone. He wrote that
// he could not get any speaker to play along.
//
// A PERMANENT group already survives this by re-forming on the master's next
// play, which is why this went unnoticed for so long: only an ordinary group is
// lost, and an ordinary group is what the multiroom screen creates by default.
