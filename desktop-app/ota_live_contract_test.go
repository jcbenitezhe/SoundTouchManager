//  1. the target is written down BEFORE anything is copied, and survives,
//  2. the app reports itself busy so the window would refuse to close,
//  3. the update runs and the speaker reaches the target state, engine included,
//  4. the record is cleared once the speaker is there,
//  5. a failure would produce a report that actually names the problem.
