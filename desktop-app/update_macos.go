// In-place update of the running .app bundle on macOS (phase 2).
//
// Until now macOS was the one platform where the update stopped halfway: STM
// downloaded the .dmg, verified it and opened it, and the user dragged the app
// into Applications by hand, every single release. Windows and Linux have
// replaced themselves since the feature existed. The reason macOS did not was
// never Gatekeeper, the app and the image are Developer ID signed and notarized
// since v0.9.33; it was that replacing a running BUNDLE is a different job from
// overwriting one file, and nobody had written it.
//
// A running .app CAN be replaced: the process keeps the files it already has
// open, so moving the bundle aside and putting a new one in its place is safe,
// and the swapped-in copy is what the next launch runs. This is what Sparkle
// has done for years. What has to be got right is everything around it:
//
//   - The source is a ZIP of the signed, STAPLED app, not the DMG. The ticket
//     lives inside the bundle, so the extracted copy passes Gatekeeper offline
//     and no second notarization round is needed for the zip itself.
//   - Extraction uses ditto, not archive/zip: a bundle carries symlinks,
//     extended attributes and the code signature, and a naive unzip silently
//     breaks the signature.
//   - The extracted app is verified against OUR identity before it is allowed
//     anywhere near /Applications. The SHA256 from the release manifest already
//     proves the download, but the swap is the one moment where a tampered
//     bundle would win, so codesign has to agree too.
//   - Everything happens on the same volume as the installed app, so the final
//     move is a rename and not a copy that can die halfway.
//
// Every failure path falls back to the old assisted flow (reveal the download),
// which is why this can ship before anyone has run it on a real Mac: the worst
// case is what users have today.
