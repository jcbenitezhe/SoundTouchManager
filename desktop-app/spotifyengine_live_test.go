// The hardware verification the engine build demands of itself.
//
// go-librespot.yml says it in its own header: an engine built from a materially
// changed source has to be heard on a real speaker before it ships. The reason
// is on the record twice. An engine built from the wrong branch started,
// authenticated, and then refused every track; and a prefetch-seek regression
// played exactly one song and stopped, which no unit test noticed because both
// the build and the tests were green while the audio was wrong.
//
// So this plays a real Spotify preset on a real speaker and watches it through
// TWO track changes, which is the point where both of those failures showed.
// It also reads the account plan, which since 2026-09-26 no longer comes from
// the engine's Web API proxy but from the engine's token plus the speaker's own
// call to Spotify.
