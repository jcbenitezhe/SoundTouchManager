// TestLiveEngineRepair covers the engine-only repair that "update all speakers"
// runs for a speaker whose agent is already current but whose Spotify engine is
// gone. It calls exactly what that row calls (App.EnsureSpotifyEngine) and
// nothing else, so the two promises the UI makes about it can be checked:
//
//   - the speaker ends up with the engine present,
//   - and it is NOT restarted to get there.
//
// The second one is the promise worth guarding. The confirmation dialog tells
// the user this group normally does not restart, and a current agent hot-swaps
// the engine in place (webui handleAgentSidecar), so an unexpected reboot would
// make the dialog a lie and interrupt whatever the speaker was playing.
//
// It adapts to the speaker it is given, because the interesting state cannot be
// created on demand: these boxes have no SSH, and the engine is only ever
// dropped by the agent itself under NAND pressure. On a speaker that HAS its
// engine this proves the no-op half (nothing delivered, nothing restarted); on
// one that lost it, the same run proves the delivery half.
