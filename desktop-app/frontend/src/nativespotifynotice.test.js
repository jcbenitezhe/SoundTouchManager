// The "press a saved Spotify button" notice, gated.
//
// A reporter with a FREE Spotify account was told to press a saved Spotify key
// while nothing was playing. He has no such key and a free account cannot make
// one, so the notice pointed at a button that does not exist, and it opened
// with "Playing on ..." over a paused session.
//
// It took three attempts. The first added "really playing" and "key exists".
// The second read state.spotifyPremiumRequired, which is written only while
// STM's OWN stream plays, and that is false exactly when this notice fires, so
// the flag was always undefined at the gate and nothing changed for the
// reporter. The third asks the speaker itself.
