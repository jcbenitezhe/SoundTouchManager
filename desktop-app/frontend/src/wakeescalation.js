// What to tell somebody whose speaker will not wake, on the second, third and
// fourth try.
//
// The first message was "still starting, try again in a moment", which is the
// one harmful thing: the speaker's power signal is a TOGGLE, so pressing again
// at a half-woken box switches it back off. That wording is gone.
//
// But the replacement was still a single sentence for every attempt, and a
// sentence that is right the first time is a dead end the fifth. A reporter
// pressed over eighty times across four log generations and read the same line
// every time (2026-09-29). Jens asked for the obvious missing piece: at some
// point STM should stop asking for patience and suggest pulling the plug.
//
// Deliberately NOT a factory reset. That wipes the presets and the Wi-Fi
// credentials, and no software should steer somebody there for a speaker that
// is merely asleep. A power cycle costs ten seconds and loses nothing.

// notReadyCounts holds consecutive failures per speaker, this session only. A
// count that survived a restart would greet somebody with "pull the plug" for a
// speaker that has been fine since yesterday.

// have now failed in a row. An unknown host still counts: one shared bucket is
// better than losing the escalation entirely.

// the next failure after a good play is a first failure, not a fifth.

//        wedged in standby
//   5+   say plainly that STM cannot get it out of standby, and point at the
//        diagnostic, because at that point more advice is noise and what is
//        needed is a log
//
// Returning a key rather than a string keeps this testable without the i18n
// bundles and keeps every language in one place.
