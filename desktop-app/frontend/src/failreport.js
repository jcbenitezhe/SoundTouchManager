// got wrong (which hosts go into the bundle, what the report says about the
// file that was just written) is asserted without a browser.

// REPORT_SEND_MARKER is the first line of the closing block the Go side writes
// (see formatFailureReport in desktop-app/updatereport.go). It is matched here
// so the closing wish can be replaced with the concrete path once the user has
// actually saved a bundle. Kept as one short literal on both sides on purpose:
// a longer match would break the first time the sentence under it is reworded.

// that was just written.
//
// The report used to end with "together with the diagnostic file if you were
// able to save one", which is a wish rather than a path: a user whose install
// failed has no idea where that file would be, so the mails arrive without it
// and the first reply is always the same request. Once the bundle exists, its
// full path goes into the text the user is about to copy, so the attachment is
// a file they can find.
