// imported to get at it: settings.js reads `navigator.userAgent` at module
// level, which exists in a browser and in Node 21 and later, and does not exist
// in Node 20. A test that imported the view to reach these helpers therefore
// passed on one machine and failed on the CI runner with
// "ReferenceError: navigator is not defined".

// LATEST_BOSE_FIRMWARE mirrors latestBoseFirmware in desktop-app/app_firmware.go,

// on purpose: the install path has to judge a CineMate or a soundbar too, and
// LATEST_FW below only lists the four speakers the settings banner covers.

// This used to be ONE link for every speaker, and that link was the SoundTouch
// 20 Series III article, on the reasoning that the steps are the same
// everywhere. They mostly are, but a SoundTouch 10 owner then opens an article
// showing a different speaker, and the owner of a Series II ST20 is sent to the
// Series III page. That came up on 2026-09-09 from a reporter whose Series II
// lost its sound after a firmware update; whatever caused that, pointing him at
// the wrong series was ours.
//
// The ST20 and the ST30 each exist in two series and the speaker does not say
// which one it is (docs/MODEL-VARIANTS.md: moduleType separates sm2 from scm,
// not the series), so those two models offer BOTH articles instead of guessing.
// Every URL below answered 200 when it was added; Bose has no model-independent
// article, that URL is a 404.
