// developer", followed by a button that had turned into "Get it from the

// their own Wi-Fi, and the obvious next move is to press download again.

// mash8336: his files are plain mp3 and the app told him the format was
// probably unsupported. His speaker logged AUDIO_ERROR_TIMEOUT and
// ERROR_NO_DECODED_DATA twenty seconds into every attempt, which is the box
// saying nothing ever arrived to decode, and his media server did not answer its
// own description fetch either.
