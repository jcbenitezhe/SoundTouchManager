// Saving a Spotify playlist to a hardware key reported success while the
// speaker already knew the key would be refused when pressed. Both
// recall paths gate on the same question; only the SAVE side had no gate.
//
// The first half shipped in v0.9.86 and asked the LOGIN question, which is what
// CanRecall answers. The half actually asked for is the ENTITLEMENT: a free
// Spotify account cannot do the on-demand playback a recall needs, so a key saved
// on one stores fine and then never plays, and nothing at save time said so.
//
// The reporter also read the login warning as a claim about his account while he
// was streaming Spotify at that moment. He was: to the speaker's own Bose
// receiver, not to STM's "(STM)" entry, which is the thing that had not been
// picked. The sentence now says which one it means.
