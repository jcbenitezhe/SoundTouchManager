// What counts as a speaker having reached the target build, and why a re-push
// of the SAME version is not the harmless no-op it looks like.
//
// A speaker that has the Spotify engine is by definition NAND-tight: the engine
// is about 16 MB and the free space on a speaker that holds one is around 11.
// So when an update is pushed, the agent drops the engine to make it fit, and
// the app is supposed to put it back once the update is confirmed.
//
// The confirmation asked "did the version STRING move". A push of the same
// version cannot satisfy that, so the flow returned before the re-delivery step
// and the engine stayed gone. The push that was meant to change nothing
// destroyed a working Spotify install instead.
//
// That path was reached in bulk by the v0.9.88 stamp skew, which told every user
// their speakers needed updating when they did not. One household ended up with
// four of six speakers with no engine, the owner having "run it a few times on a
// couple of speakers", each run doing more damage than the last. The stamp is
// fixed, but a same-version push still happens on purpose (a rollback repair, a
// reinstall), so the destructive half is fixed here rather than left to the
// trigger being gone.
