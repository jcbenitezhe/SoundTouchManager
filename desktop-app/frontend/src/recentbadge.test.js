// Field evidence (2026-08-24, three-ST10 bundle): speaker A (the app's
// current box) played "Exclusively Rush"; the user scoped the Recently-played
// view to speaker B, whose history also contains a Rush card from an earlier
// session. state.nowName describes speaker A, but cardIsPlaying compared every
// card against it regardless of the card's box, so speaker B's Rush card wore
// the green badge while B was actually playing "101 SMOOTH JAZZ".
