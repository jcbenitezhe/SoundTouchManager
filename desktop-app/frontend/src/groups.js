// the raw hex key as its label, and its x had no box to send the dissolve to,
// so it was a silent no-op (field bundle 2026-09-07). Which side is "wrong"
// does not matter here; the frame has to survive the disagreement.
//
// So the ID is only the FIRST of three ways to ask, and each later one needs
// less of it than the one before:
//   1. by uppercased deviceID OR boxDeviceID, the second identity a speaker
//      publishes for exactly this reason: boxDeviceID is what its own firmware
//      calls it, so it matches a key taken from a zone document even when the
//      two disagree. An older agent announces none, which is what the two
//      ID-free steps below are for,
//   2. by address: a zone entry naming mk also carries the leader's senderIP,
//      and the box at that address is the leader - but only when that box's own
//      answer names mk too, so a senderIP left over from a group that has since
//      been rebuilt can never nominate a stranger,
//   3. ID-free: among the boxes whose entry names mk, the leader is the one
//      whose own answer does not list itself in members[]. A follower's
//      /getZone names the master and lists only itself; the leader's lists the
//      followers. Ambiguity (none, or several) resolves to null rather than to
//      a guess: the caller then falls back to a generic label, which is honest,
//      while a guessed box would send a dissolve to the wrong speaker.
