// Four things the pre-release sweep caught on 2026-09-11, three of them in code
// that had shipped or was about to.
//
// The worst was mine from the day before. The library delivery probe was written
// as a fetch() from this page to the media server, and a DLNA server sends no
// Access-Control-Allow-Origin, so the browser refuses the answer however healthy
// the server is. Measured against two servers on one LAN: both answer 206 with
// the requested range and no access-control header at all. The catch returned
// false, which is the server-is-at-fault verdict, so every failed library play
// would have blamed the user's NAS, including the high-resolution FLAC the whole
// function was written around.
