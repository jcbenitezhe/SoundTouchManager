//
// The agent refuses a save whose station already sits on another key, and that
// refusal has to stay: the version that silently deleted the other key is what
// wiped preset after preset. But a refusal on its own left the user
// nowhere. Read it as a bug; discussion read it as "so I
// can only keep one Spotify playlist" and stopped at one. Both were asking for
// the same missing option, so the note now offers to MOVE the station to the key
// the user pressed. A move is an explicit act, which is why it is allowed where
// the silent delete is not.

// parsePresetConflict pulls the other key and the name of what sits on it out
// of the agent's 409, as it reaches the frontend: a rejected binding whose
// message carries the JSON body. Returns null for every other failure, so
// callers fall through to their normal error path.
