// reported by shorty310 eight hours after v0.9.79 shipped: a station
// started from Find stations plays, but the app shows no artist and no track,
// while the page the speaker itself serves shows both.
//
// The app asked the speaker for the live title only when it could resolve a
// preset SLOT number out of the now-playing location. A station started from
// Find stations is pushed as /stream/raw?u=<base64> and belongs to no preset, so
// there is no slot, so the poll never ran. The agent had "Rush - Freewill" the
// whole time, which is exactly why the remote showed it.
//
// A slot number was always the wrong question. What both call sites actually
// want to know is whether the stream proxy is in the path, because that is where
// an ICY title comes from.
