// A refusal with a reason, answered with "send me the logs".
//
// FormZone returns ok:false for two different things. One is the firmware
// shrugging: the master accepted the call and formed nothing. The other
// is the app refusing on purpose because a participant is half of a live
// stereo pair - that shape starves the audio, so the box is never even
// asked, and the answer carries inPair plus a reason string.
//
// The Multi-Room view has told them apart. The group chips on the
// Musik hoeren tab did not: every ok:false got multiroom.formedNone, which
// ends in "try Mirror mode, hit Refresh, or update the speakers, then send
// logs". A user with a stereo pair on his terrace did all four and sent the
// logs (mail 2026-09-25). Nothing was wrong with his speakers.
