// A second Update click on a speaker whose update is already running.
//
// Sascha's SoundTouch 30, 2026-09-14: the first update was uploading, he
// pressed Update again, and the app showed him a failure report with a
// copyable Go error. The update itself was fine and finished a minute later on
// v0.9.82. Two things were wrong and both are pinned here.
//
// The functions are re-implemented rather than imported, the same way
// errornoise.test.js does it: main.js runs its app bootstrap at module load, so
// importing it into a test environment starts the whole application. What
// matters is the SHAPE of the two decisions, and that is what this pins.

// 1. The latch. state.otaInProgress is only raised AFTER the stick gate and the
// Wi-Fi preflight, two awaited network round-trips, so it cannot stop a second
// click that arrives inside that window. A synchronous flag set before the
// first await can.

// 2. The classification. The one-write-per-speaker guard marks its refusal with
// a stable token so the window can tell "your second start was turned away"
// apart from "the update failed". Matching the prose instead would break on the
// next rewording, and it is the prose that reached the user as an error.
