// sourceinputs.js — the line inputs a speaker actually has, taken from the
// speaker's own source list.
//
// The music tab used to offer two fixed buttons, AUX and Bluetooth. That is
// every input a one-piece SoundTouch has and no input a soundbar has, so four
// owners across three chassis families were left with sockets they could not
// reach: a SoundTouch 300 with TV and HDMI (discussion item 1), an SA-5
// whose three line inputs all arrive as source AUX and differ only in the
// account, a CineMate 130 with TV, CBL-Sat, BD-DVD, Game and Aux on the
// back,. The CineMate owner had to pick up the Bose
// infrared remote to get his television sound back once he had switched to
// radio, because the app offered him no way back.
//
// So the buttons come from what the speaker reports, and two rules that look
// obvious are wrong on hardware:
//
//   - status is NOT a capability. /sources status is a CONNECTION indicator: a
//     SoundTouch 10's Bluetooth says UNAVAILABLE simply because nothing is
//     paired to it, and an HDMI socket with the television switched off can be
//     expected to look the same. Filtering on status would hide exactly the
//     input the owner wants back.
//   - isLocal alone is not enough. QPlay reports isLocal=true on every box
//     measured (Portable, SoundTouch 10, SoundTouch 30 on 2026-08-09) and is a
//     network protocol, so taking isLocal at face value puts two buttons
//     labelled "QPlay1UserName" under everybody's inputs.
//
// What separates a socket from a service slot is the account: the firmware
// gives every service slot an account ending in "UserName" (QPlay1UserName,
// UPnPUserName, SpotifyConnectUserName, StoredMusicUserName) and a physical
// socket never has one. That rule needs no list of input names, which matters
// because the input names are the part that cannot be known in advance: a
// CineMate calls its analogue input LOCAL where a SoundTouch 10 says AUX, and a
// soundbar's sockets arrive as PRODUCT with the socket name in sourceAccount.
//
// The speaker's own phone page carries the same two rules in isPhysicalInput
// (internal/webui/assets/index.html); the agent validates the chosen source
// against the box's list before it builds the ContentItem.
