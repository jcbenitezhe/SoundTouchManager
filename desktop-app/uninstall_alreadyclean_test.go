// Pressing Remove on a speaker that is already clean is the most ordinary thing
// a user does: the first run gave no visible confirmation, so they press it

// everything after: the app kept remembering a now-stock speaker as an STM one,
// and the reboot that closes root SSH never ran.
//
// A reporter hit it on 2026-08-23 and then asked exactly the question the bug
// produces: why did one speaker flip to "READY FOR STM" on its own while the
// other needed the app restarted. The first came off in one go. The second was
// a second attempt.
