// Which address the QR code for a speaker's phone remote ends up carrying.
//
// The IP is what it used to be, and an IP is the thing that changes: a new DHCP
// lease and the page a phone has on its home screen points at nothing, with
// nothing to tell the person why. A name survives that.
//
// The reason this is a matrix and not a one-liner is that a name which is merely
// PLAUSIBLE is worse than the IP, and the reference network shows why looking at
// a name is not enough to judge it. Its FRITZ!Box serves one name per speaker
// and hands back "B--roPortable.fritz.box" for the Portable: the speaker's
// umlaut, mangled on the way out of the router. It looks broken and it works,
// because the router mangles it the same way in both directions. Tried on the
// five-speaker network on 2026-09-27, all five names verified.
//
// So the decision is made by resolving and reaching, never by reading. The case
// that makes that non-negotiable is a stale lease: it resolves perfectly and
// answers a DIFFERENT speaker, which would print one speaker's QR code on
// another's panel, and only the identity check catches it.
