// The speaker's SSH port as a switch, bound for the settings screen.

// Background in internal/webui/sshsetting.go. The short version: since the SSH
// opt-in a speaker keeps the port closed unless a marker on NAND says otherwise,
// and the only way to place that marker was over SSH. Two users run SSH
// deliberately and asked for it to stay; the same switch serves both of them and
// the people who want it shut.
