// Cold-start discovery hardening.
//
// Field report (maintainer's own multi-NIC Windows PC, 2026-07-09): on every
// app start the speaker list came up without the Portable and only a manual
// re-scan found it. Two compounding causes:
//
//   - mDNS returns zero instances on that machine (multi-NIC zeroconf
//     flakiness), so everything rides on the TCP fallback sweep.
//   - The sweep walked ALL local /24s through ONE worker pool inside one
//     shared 12 s budget, in interface-enumeration order. Hyper-V/WSL
//     "vEthernet" adapters enumerate before Wi-Fi and their 2x254 dead hosts
//     each hold a worker for the full 3 s probe timeout on a cold neighbor
//     cache - the budget dies before the REAL subnet is reached. A second
//     scan succeeds because Windows' negative neighbor-cache entries now fail
//     those probes instantly. Hence "always missing at start, found on the
//     first manual scan".
//
// Three fixes, layered (compatibility first):
//   1. Every subnet sweeps in PARALLEL with its own worker pool, so a dead
//      virtual subnet can never starve the real one.
//   2. The subnet of the primary outbound route is probed first.
//   3. The speakers seen last time are persisted (known-speakers.json) and
//      probed DIRECTLY at the start of every discovery - a hit needs one
//      3 s probe, no sweep at all.
