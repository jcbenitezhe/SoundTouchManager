// Command winresgen writes the Windows version resource for the desktop app.
//
// Why this exists. The released Windows binary carries no version information
// at all: reading its resources shows an icon, an icon group and a manifest,
// and no version block. Explorer therefore shows blank fields, the first-run
// warning names no publisher, and an antivirus heuristic sees a large
// executable that talks to the network, updates itself, and says nothing about
// who made it. v0.9.48 was flagged by two scanners, and one user could not
// install it because Windows quarantined the download.
//
// Wails is supposed to generate this from build/windows/info.json and does not:
// it skips the block without complaint when its template comes back empty, and
// three plausible causes were tested and eliminated (a missing product version,
// a three part version where Windows wants four, and the unusual language
// identifier in the default template). Rather than keep guessing at somebody
// else's build step, STM writes the block itself.
//
// The output is the COMPLETE resource: icon, manifest and version, taken from
// the same build/windows files Wails reads. It has to be complete because the
// Go linker refuses a second resource section ("too many .rsrc sections"), so
// this replaces the one Wails writes rather than adding to it. The build calls
// wails with -nopackage for exactly that reason.
//
// The file is a build artefact and is not committed, in the same way as the
// embedded helper binaries.
