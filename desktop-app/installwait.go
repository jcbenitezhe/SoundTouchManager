// What the install says when its agent-wait budget runs out.
//
// A SoundTouch 10 (bundle 2026-09-06) had its agent up about 120 s after the
// network install, well inside the 180 s budget, but the PC could not reach
// the box at all for several more minutes. The install was reported "FAILED
// step=reboot code=agent-not-up", the user was told the agent did not come
// up, and the speaker went on to work.
//
// The reason first written here was that the box's Wi-Fi came back late
// because it carries two saved profiles and tried the dead one first. The
// box's own forensics contradict that and the sentence is corrected rather
// than left to become received wisdom: carrier, LAN address and gateway ARP
// were healthy through the entire unreachable window. What the speaker WAS
// doing, on both reporters' boxes, is running the firmware's own setup
// state machine: its Wi-Fi light blinks fast, it raises its own setup access
// point, and while that AP is up it is not on the home network at all. From
// the PC that is indistinguishable from a dead speaker.
//
// The budget stays. What changes is the verdict when it runs out, and that it
// is now a verdict of three rather than two:
//
//	agent-not-up      the speaker answers its own Bose port and STM does not.
//	                  Today's strict wording, the case it was written for.
//	speaker-in-setup  the speaker is running its own out-of-box setup, which
//	                  it leaves by itself, usually inside a quarter of an hour.
//	speaker-not-back  it answers nothing at any layer. Not a failure, a
//	                  speaker that is not back yet.
//
// The last two are waits, not failures: a bounded watcher keeps looking and
// corrects the journal and the screen when the agent answers after all.
