// Purge of the app's own memory of a speaker after STM was removed from it.
//
// UninstallSTM puts the speaker back to stock, but the app kept remembering
// it as the STM speaker it used to be: the agent port it answered on, the
// post-OTA pin, an unfinished update intent (which toasted "update unfinished"
// for two weeks on a speaker that had no STM left), the stereo-pair name it
// was half of, the world-map "already invited for this box" flag, and its
// line in known-speakers.json. None of those records is true any more once the
// speaker is stock, and each one made the speaker come back looking like
// something other than the plain installable speaker it now is.
//
// purgeSpeakerState drops every one of them. It is deliberately the ONLY
// place that knows the full list, so a new per-speaker record only has to be
// added here. History files (ota-history.log, str.log) are kept on purpose:
// they are a record of what happened, not a claim about the speaker's state.
// The preset stash (preset_stash.go) is kept for the same reason: it records
// what was on the speaker's keys, and the next install reads it.
//
// What is NOT purged, because it lives off this PC: the removed speaker stays
// in its former peers' sticky roster (POST /api/peers/seed is additive; each
// agent ages it out on its own) and as a remembered member of a permanent
// group on its master. Both are a decision for the fleet, not for this PC.

// throughout: an uninstall that succeeded on the speaker must never be
// reported as failed because a cache file on the PC could not be rewritten.
