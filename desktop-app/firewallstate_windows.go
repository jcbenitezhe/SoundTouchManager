// Read from the registry rather than from `netsh advfirewall`: netsh is a
// subprocess that can take a second and, on some managed machines, raises a
// consent dialog. A HKLM read of the firewall policy is allowed for a normal
// user, cannot prompt, and is the value the netsh output is printed from
// anyway. Any error at all simply omits the line; a failure report that fails
// is worse than a thin one.
//
// The wording is deliberately narrow. This says the firewall is ON, and that
// is ALL it says: it does not read the per-application rules, so it cannot
// tell whether SoundTouch Manager is allowed through. Overstating it here would send
// the next user off to turn a firewall off for nothing, which is the same
// wrong-blame this whole report was rewritten to stop.
