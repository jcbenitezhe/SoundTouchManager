// Keeping the session that went wrong.

// These logs exist to answer "what happened during that update". The person who
// needs that answer is, by definition, somebody whose update looked wrong, and
// the reasonable first thing to do about that is restart the app. With one slot
// kept, the restart that follows noticing a problem overwrites the run that
// caused it, and the second restart overwrites the first.
//
// A reporter whose speakers lost their Spotify engine across four re-pushes sent
// a bundle in which not one of those four runs survived (2026-09-27). The engine
// deletions were reconstructed from the speakers' own logs instead, which only
// worked because the speakers keep more history than the app did.
