// sshFlagSets is a fallback chain of OpenSSH option lists, tried
// in order until one negotiates successfully. Whatever set wins
// the very first call is cached in sshFlagsActive and reused for
// every subsequent call in the same session — we only pay the
// trial-and-error cost on the first probe.
//
// Why a chain instead of one set: OpenSSH option names have churned
// over the years and STM ships to users on every OpenSSH from
// macOS Big Sur (8.1, 2020) to current Linux/Windows (10.x).
// v0.5.2 used PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms (8.5+ only) and was rejected
// on Big Sur with "Bad configuration option" before negotiation
// even started. A static single set will keep tripping on someone
// somewhere; a fallback chain self-heals against future renames.
//
// Set order (most aggressive first, simplest last):
//
//  1. "full-legacy" — every legacy class explicitly patched: host
//     key, KEX, ciphers, MACs. Needed for the 2014-era Bose sshd
//     that only offers ssh-rsa / SHA1 / CBC. Works on every OpenSSH
//     from 6.x through current 10.x.
//
//  2. "host-key-only" — only -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa
//     plus the connection-hygiene flags. If the user's ssh barfs
//     on any one of the algo-class options (some BSD-derived ssh
//     forks have spelled them differently), this strict subset
//     still lets the connection start: the box's ssh-rsa host key
//     will be accepted, the rest of the negotiation falls back to
//     whatever the user's ssh and the box can agree on out of the
//     box. Slightly less reliable against very modern OpenSSH that
//     disabled SHA1 KEX entirely, but works in more places.
//
//  3. "bare" — only connection hygiene (StrictHostKeyChecking=no,
//     known-hosts → /dev/null, BatchMode, ConnectTimeout). Last
//     resort: if the user's ssh rejects EVERY algo option,
//     including HostKeyAlgorithms, there's nothing else for us to
//     touch — we hand off to whatever the user's ssh defaults are
//     and hope the user's ~/.ssh/config covers the gap. On Bose's
//     2014 sshd this will usually fail at host-key verification,
//     but the resulting error ("Host key verification failed") is
//     actionable: the user can manually accept by adjusting their
//     ssh config. Better than a hard wall.
//
// StrictHostKeyChecking=no + UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null are
// present in EVERY set because: (a) the Bose box's host key rotates
// on factory reset, which we trigger as part of bootstrap, so
// accept-new would refuse the very next install attempt on a
// re-flashed box; (b) the connection is over the user's home LAN
// to a device whose IP they just selected from a discovery list —
// there is no realistic MITM vector to defend against.
//
// LogLevel=ERROR is the necessary companion to those two and is also
// in every set. With UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null the host is never
// remembered, so OpenSSH prints "Warning: Permanently added '<host>'
// (<key>) to the list of known hosts." on stderr on EVERY connect.
// CombinedOutput folds that INFO-level banner in ahead of the remote
// command's stdout, and the SSH NAND-install fallback's byte-count
// verify read the banner as part of the count and failed a
// byte-perfect transfer as "truncated" (ST30 stick-power, 13.06). ERROR
// drops that INFO banner while still surfacing every
// negotiation/auth/host-key error classifySSHError keys on (those are
// ERROR/FATAL level); QUIET would hide those too, so ERROR not QUIET.
