// Everything SoundTouch Manager can find out about a failed install or update at the
// moment it fails, without asking the user a single question.
//
// Why this file exists: the report a user mailed in on 2026-08-23 (an install
// onto 192.168.1.34 that never reached the speaker) consisted of six header
// lines, one "context deadline exceeded" string, and three sentences of
// firewall advice the same user had just read on the screen above it. Nothing
// in it could tell apart the four failures that actually happen here:
//
//	the speaker is off or asleep,
//	the speaker is on a different subnet than this PC (guest Wi-Fi),
//	something dropped the packets (firewall / client isolation),
//	the speaker answered fine but on a port we did not ask about.
//
// All four are decidable from this PC in a few seconds, and every fact is
// about the user's own equipment, so the report carries them now and nobody
// has to write back asking for a second attempt that nobody makes.
//
// Hard rules for everything below:
//   - best effort. A probe that cannot run omits its line. A failure report
//     that itself fails is worse than a thin one.
//   - bounded. The user is staring at a failure screen; the whole gather stays
//     inside a few seconds and every subprocess runs under a context.
//   - no more of the user's data than the user already sees. The report is
//     deliberately NOT anonymized (the real IPs are the point of it), but a
//     speaker MAC is its Bose deviceID and a Wi-Fi name is nobody's business,
//     so the MAC is cut to its vendor prefix and the log tail goes through
//     redactSSIDs, same rule as commit 074b5dd.
