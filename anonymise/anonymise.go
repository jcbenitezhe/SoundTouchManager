// Package anonymise strips personal data out of text that leaves a machine:
// diagnostic bundles, copyable failure reports, and the speaker's own debug
// state when a phone asks for it.
//
// It lives at the top level rather than under internal/ because the desktop app
// is a separate Go module and Go forbids importing another module's internal/.
// discovery/, dlna/ and sticksetup/ are here for the same reason.
//
// One implementation, two callers, on purpose. It used to live in the desktop
// app alone, on the assumption that the app was the only thing that ever
// exported this text. The speaker's phone remote grew a diagnostic button that
// fetches /api/debug/state and saves it directly, that assumption stopped being
// true, and 32 of the 36 files people attached to public issues that way
// carried their real LAN addresses and MAC addresses. Copying the regex list
// into the agent would have set up the next drift; the comment above
// ScrubIdentities already warned about exactly that.
//
// The hashes are SHA256 prefixes over a salt the exporting machine keeps and
// never ships. Within one exporter the old property holds, so the same speaker
// carries the same DEV# across reports months apart. Between the two exporters
// the tokens differ, because the PC and the speaker each hold their own salt,
// and that is the price of the tokens no longer being reversible: a MAC was a
// 24-bit sweep, about 25 seconds, and a list of common room names recovered 14%
// of the speaker names in a 72-bundle corpus.

// ssidRedactRegex is the SINGLE pass that removes network names and Wi-Fi

//
// Three shapes, in order of specificity:
//
//  1. key="value" - how the firmware echoes a profile back
//     (<profile ssid="Home Network 5G" password="..." />). The bare form below
//     truncates such a value at its first space, so the tail of any network
//     name containing a space used to ship in clear.
//  2. seeding 'value' - the box's boot script logs the Wi-Fi failover seed
//     with the network name in single quotes and no "ssid" token anywhere on
//     the line, so nothing caught it. A real household network name shipped
//     inside a user's bundle that way (found 2026-08-22), against the bundle
//     README's promise that SSIDs and Wi-Fi passwords never leave the host.
//     The boot script no longer logs the name, but a speaker on an older agent
//     already has the line on its NAND and hands it to the next bundle.
//  3. the bare key form, which is what the original pattern covered.
//
// Deliberately narrow: only these shapes. A general "anything in quotes" rule
// would gut radio station names and preset labels, which are what a bundle is
// usually read for.
// The marker is the FIRST alternative on purpose. It contains the word "ssid"
// itself, so without it the bare-key alternative matches INSIDE an already
// redacted marker and grows a "<" on every pass ("<<SSID-REDACTED>"). Text does
// go through this more than once: sanitizeLog and anonymizeText both call
// scrubPII, and nested structures are walked field by field. Matching the
// marker and handing it back untouched is what makes the pass idempotent.
// Every quoted value is bounded to its own LINE, and an unterminated one is
// redacted to the end of that line. Go's negated classes match newlines, so
// `[^"]*` on an unterminated attribute ran to the next quote anywhere later in
// the blob and swallowed whole log lines in between - and the scrub sees the
// box's setup log as one 64 KB blob, where truncation is routine: the boot
// script cuts a profile dump at 300 bytes and the seed response at 200, both of
// which land mid-attribute. Falling through to the bare-key alternative then
// leaked the tail. The seeding value stops at a newline rather than at the
// LAST quote on its line rather than the first, so a network called "Bob's
// WiFi" does not ship its tail; the unterminated case is a separate
// alternative so a terminated value does not greedily eat the rest of the
