// Supplemental root certificates, and why the agent carries any.
//
// The scm chassis ships /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt with 2 certificates
// where sm2 ships 166. The thin set lacks DigiCert Global Root G2 and ISRG
// Root X1, so those speakers refuse most https stations and the Spotify engine
// dies on its first call. The file belongs to the read-only firmware, a
// factory reset cannot change it, and Bose's update servers are gone, so
// nothing on the speaker can restore it.
//
// What this does NOT do is change what the SPEAKER trusts. Nothing is
// mounted, nothing under /etc is touched, nothing is written to NAND. The
// agent composes a bundle in tmpfs from the store the speaker already has
// PLUS the roots below, and points its OWN process at it. go-librespot
// inherits that through the environment; the Bose firmware keeps exactly the
// trust Bose shipped.
//
// The environment variable only replaces the FILE half of crypto/x509's
// loader: certDirectories is governed by SSL_CERT_DIR alone, which is never
// set here, so the directory scan stays live and the composed file is strictly
// additive (GOROOT/src/crypto/x509/root_unix.go, loadSystemRoots). This is
// specific to Go. OpenSSL reads the same variable differently, which is why
// nothing that is not Go may be pointed at this file.
