// Whether the trust store on disk is the trust store this PROCESS uses.
//
// These are not the same question, and a field bundle cost two releases to
// teach that. Go reads the system trust store once per process and caches it.
// The boot script mounts STM's overlay AFTER the agent has started, and the
// agent reaches for TLS within seconds of starting (the Spotify engine
// launches almost immediately). So a speaker can hold a perfectly healthy
// store on disk while every handshake in the running process still fails
// against the copy it cached at startup.
//
// The first version of the repair only restarted when it had CHANGED a file.
// On the reporter's ST20 nothing needed changing at the moment it looked: the
// store it reads was already healthy, the other one was beyond saving, and the
// agent went on failing every https station with a diagnostic that said both
// stores were fine. Nothing in the file state could have revealed that. Only
// asking the process itself can.
//
// The check is deliberately network-free. A handshake against some public host
// would answer the same question, but it would also fail for a speaker with no
// route, a captive portal or a slow DNS, and turn every one of those into a
// spurious restart.

// maxRootsProbed bounds the work: a store holds well over a hundred roots and
// parsing all of them on a speaker CPU buys nothing. Several are tried rather
// than one because an individual root may legitimately be expired, which would
// make a single sample say "stale cache" when the cache is fine.
