// The trust store overlay and how it breaks.
//
// The boot script copies the firmware's own CA bundle to /tmp, appends STM's
// root and bind-mounts the result over the original. When it copied while an
// overlay from an earlier run was still mounted, source and destination were
// the same inode: the copy read and wrote one file and could leave it empty.
// What then got mounted was STM's root and nothing else, and the box stopped
// trusting every public certificate. Every https station and the Spotify
// engine die seconds apart on the identical "x509: certificate signed by
// unknown authority" (ST20 field bundle, 2026-08-13).
//
// setup/run.sh and usb-stick/run.sh no longer produce that state. That fix
// alone does not reach a speaker that is already installed: an over-the-air
// update replaces the agent binary and nothing else, and the NAND copy of the
// boot script is only ever refreshed from a physical USB stick. A box that
// entered the broken state would keep re-entering it at every boot, forever,
// no matter how many updates it received.
//
// So the agent repairs it. Reading the pristine firmware bundle means taking
// the broken overlay off first, which is also the rollback: if anything below
// fails, the firmware's own bundle is what stays live. That is the safe
// direction. A box that trusts the internet but not STM still plays radio and
// Spotify, and RefreshTrustStore re-appends our root; the reverse leaves the
// speaker unable to reach anything.

// overlayDir is where the overlay files that get bind-mounted over the trust
// store live. tmpfs on the box, so this costs no NAND and starts empty after
// every boot. A variable only so the tests can put it somewhere that exists
// on a dev host.
