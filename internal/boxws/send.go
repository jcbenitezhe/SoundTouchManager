// The SEND half of the box WebSocket, and the one write that needs it.
//
// boxws was a pure listener until 2026-09-10: it consumed the gabbo stream and
// the only bytes it ever wrote were keepalive pings. That was not an oversight,
// it was the whole design. STM writes to the speaker over the plain HTTP API on
// :8090, which is documented, easy to reason about, and answers with a status.
//
// The stereo BALANCE of a pair is the one setting that API will not take.
// Measured live on two SoundTouch 10s (2026-08-04): the read works, and every
// POST /balance hung the endpoint until the speaker was woken again, including
// the exact body the widely-copied community reference sends. STM has shown the
// balance read-only ever since, and the comment on the read handler said the
// firmware accepted no write that sticks.
//
// That was one interface short of the truth. On 2026-09-09 gesellix reported on
// and then in gesellix/Bose-SoundTouch#699 with the source of Stockholm
// (the web app Bose ships ON the speaker), that Bose's own client never writes
// balance over HTTP either. It sends it here, on this socket, and only here:
//
//	function y(e,t){ d({uID:e, path:"balance", rootNode:"balanceSet",
//	                    obj:{VALUE:t.toString()}}) }   // setBalance
//
// So the negative result was about HTTP, not about the firmware, and the reason
// nobody had tried the socket is in the first paragraph: there was no code path
// from which a write could be attempted. This file is that path.
