// Package boxws connects to the Bose WebSocket notification stream on port
// 8080 (subprotocol "gabbo") and reacts to incoming events.
//
// When a user presses a physical preset button on the box, the BoseApp sends
// an `<updates>` message over this WebSocket with `presetSelectionUpdated` or
// `nowPlayingUpdated`. We hook the event and trigger our UPnP player with the
// associated stream URL.
//
// This is what makes the hardware preset buttons work even though Bose's own
// music services are disabled in the firmware.

	// OnUserStop is fired when the box reports that playback was stopped
	// (playStatus STOP_STATE in a nowPlayingUpdated event), i.e. the user
	// deliberately stopped it via remote/box. The agent uses this to avoid
	// running the auto-resume against a deliberate stop.

	// OnThumbActivity is fired when the box reports a "bare"
	// userActivityUpdate: a key press without an accompanying
	// volume/nowPlaying/preset event. On this firmware the remote thumb keys
	// only deliver this generic event with no up/down identity; a bare
	// userActivity is the best available approximation for a thumb press. The
	// agent uses it as a (single, non up/down-distinguishable) trigger for a
	// configured webhook. Debounced and filtered against volume/preset in
	// boxws; still heuristic, hence live tunable.
	OnThumbActivity(ctx context.Context)

	// change). For the optional "power" webhook (additive only: STM cannot
	// suppress the firmware-side power on/off). Beta.

	// optional "aux" webhook (additive only; the firmware switches the input
	// anyway). Detected heuristically via the source change, hence beta.

	// OnZoneChanged is fired when the box changes its multiroom zone or its
	// stereo pair (zoneUpdated). This lets STM also know about groups that
	// were NOT formed in STM (e.g. a stereo pair defined in AfterTouch/Bose),
	// instead of discarding the frame as "unrecognized". z.Master == "" means
	// the zone was dissolved.

	// OnGroupChanged is fired when the box's STEREO PAIR changes (groupUpdated).
	// The firmware keeps pairs separate from zones, so this is the only event
	// that reports one. g.Paired() == false means the pair was torn down, from
	// whichever app did it - including the Bose app, which STM cannot observe
	// any other way.
	OnGroupChanged(ctx context.Context, g GroupState)

	// OnPowerWake is fired when the box comes out of standby: either via a
	// powerStateUpdated (NOT STANDBY) on firmware that sends it, OR, on
	// SoundTouch firmware that does NOT send a powerStateUpdated (Portable/
	// taigan, confirmed live 2026-06-13), via the DO_NOT_RESUME restore of the
	// last selection on wake. Driver for the optional "resume the last station
	// on power-on" default. A self-wake (stereo pair/zone) looks identical and
	// is caught downstream via the zone membership (webui.boxInZone), not here.
