// Info, the level the NAND-mirrored log keeps.
//
// Recognising it is all that is wanted here. The frame carries no value, the
// balance itself is read over HTTP, and it must NOT count as explained user
// activity: like swUpdateStatusUpdated it rides along with source changes, so
// feeding it to the thumb heuristic would swallow real thumb presses. That is
// why it belongs in the documented-no-op case rather than getting a hook.
