// Package atomicfile writes a file durably, so an unclean shutdown cannot leave
// it empty or torn.
//
// A plain os.WriteFile followed by os.Rename is ATOMIC for a concurrent reader
// (it sees either the old file or the whole new one) but it is NOT DURABLE: the
// rename's metadata can reach stable storage while the file's data blocks are
// still sitting in the page cache. If power is lost at that moment, the renamed
// file is present but its data is gone, so it comes back as ZERO BYTES.
//
// On the SoundTouch speakers this is not a corner case. They cut power at
// standby, so a file written shortly before an overnight standby routinely came
// back empty the next morning: presets.json and last-play.json were found at 0
// bytes on users' boxes, which wiped every preset (2026-07-15). WriteFile fixes
// that by fsyncing the data to flash BEFORE the rename and fsyncing the directory
// AFTER, so both the data and the rename survive a power-cut.

// Writes to the same path are serialized in this process.
//
// The temp sibling is named after the target ("<path>.tmp"), which is what
// keeps the rename on one filesystem and leaves at most ONE stale file behind
// after a kill. The cost is that two goroutines writing the same path share
// that name: the second one truncates the first one's temp file mid-write, and
// then the first one either renames a torn mix into place or fails outright.
// The second half was seen in the field on 2026-09-08, a preset recall and the
// resume guard both updating last-play.json in the same moment:
//
//	last-play persist failed err="rename: rename /mnt/nv/stmanager/last-play.json.tmp
//	  /mnt/nv/stmanager/last-play.json: no such file or directory"
//
// A per-path lock is the right fix here rather than a unique temp name: the
// agent is the only writer of these files, and unique names would litter a
// 31 MB NAND with one orphan per unclean shutdown. The map holds one entry per
// store file, about a dozen for the life of the process.
