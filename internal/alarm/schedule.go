// and time.Date returns the real instant an hour later rather than an error, so
// the alarm still goes off that morning. On the fall-back day 02:30 happens
// twice, and time.Date resolves it to a single one of them (measured: the
// second, in standard time), so the alarm goes off once at the wall-clock
// reading the user set, which is what an alarm clock is for. Go documents that
// choice as not guaranteed, so the tests assert that it resolves to one instant
// on the right day and not which side of the transition it lands on.
