// noteReconnect records one upstream disconnect that forces a reconnect, for the
// radio_stream_health debug section and a single consolidated WARN. reason is a
// coarse tag (eof|read-fail); connBytes/connDur describe the connection that
// just ended; gap is how long the box has gone without audio. A station switch
// (different upstream URL) restarts the tally so the numbers describe the
// station currently playing, not a lifetime total.
//
// This is instrumentation only: it changes no playback behavior. It exists so a
// reporter's next diagnostic bundle answers "how often, and why" for an
// intermittent dropout without hand-counting log lines (Erich, ORF Vorarlberg,
// 2026-08-28): reason=eof at a steady cadence points at CDN token expiry;
// reason=read-fail with erratic timing points at the box's own uplink.
// noteHealthStart records the station a proxied stream is serving, the moment
// it starts rather than the first time it drops. Called from noteStreamStart,
// which already runs at every proxy handler start, so every path is covered.
//
// Until this existed, every field of radio_stream_health was written only by
// noteReconnect, so a station that had been playing happily for hours reported
// an empty upstreamURL and zeroes across the board. In a diagnostic bundle that
// reads as "no radio is playing", which is the opposite of the truth and is
// exactly the wrong way round for a dropout report: the healthy stretch is
// invisible and only the trouble is recorded.
//
// It cost a live misreading on 2026-09-24, where the empty section was taken as
// proof that a test stream was not running through the proxy at all while the
// log showed it plainly.
//
// A station switch restarts the tally here too, by the same rule noteReconnect
// uses, so the numbers always describe the station currently playing.
