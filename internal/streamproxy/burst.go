// burst.go: trimming the upstream's burst-on-connect when STM RECONNECTS
// mid-stream, so the listener does not hear the last half minute again.
//
// The bug it fixes (SoundTouch 30, reported "the stream jumps back about
// 20 to 30 seconds and then stays in that loop"): an Icecast/Triton edge hands
// every new connection a large prebuffer before it settles to real time. On the
// FIRST connect that burst is exactly right, it is the box's prebuffer. On a
// RECONNECT it is audio the listener has already heard, and STM forwarded it
// verbatim.
//
// From the reporter's own log, 13 independent connections to the same station
// delivered 364-400 KB (mean ~388 KB) in their first three to eight seconds and
// then settled to 11.4-12.3 KB/s, the nominal 96 kbps of the stream. That is
// 32 to 34 seconds of audio on every reconnect, against a median hole of 14
// seconds. The difference, about 19 seconds, is what he heard repeat. It looped
// because the reconnects came 7 to 90 seconds apart, so the next burst landed
// before the box had played out the last one and the audio position barely
// advanced.
//
// The trim keeps only as much of the burst as the hole actually needs.
