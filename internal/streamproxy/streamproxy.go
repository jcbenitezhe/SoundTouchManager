// Package streamproxy wraps third-party radio streams in a stable URL that
// Bose's UPnP player can no longer let go of.
//
// Background: many modern radio stations (1LIVE, SWR3, Rock Antenne via
// streamonkey) answer with an HTTP 302 redirect to a CDN URL carrying a
// signed token. Bose's UPnP player does follow the redirect, but holds on
// to the per-token URL. When the token expires after a few hours, the CDN
// kills the connection — Bose registers that as "stream dead" and goes into
// INVALID_SOURCE. The user's impression: "the station stops playing after a
// while".
//
// With this proxy Bose always sees the same URL
// `http://127.0.0.1:8888/stream/<slot>`. The stick agent internally resolves
// the redirect to the CDN and streams the bytes through. When the CDN kills
// the connection (token expiry), the proxy reconnects IMMEDIATELY — Bose's
// TCP connection stays open, so Bose never notices a drop.
