// The box asked the proxy for `bytes=253170-` while reading the file's header.
// The proxy forwarded no Range at all, so the upstream answered from byte 0, the
// box read a few kilobytes of the wrong part of the file, gave up with
// AUDIO_ERROR_DECODER and retried five seconds later.
//
// Forwarding every Range would be wrong: "bytes=0-" is what a plain player sends
// for any stream, radio included, and a live stream handed a Range can answer in
// ways nobody here wants. A non-zero start is the thing no radio listener ever
// asks for, so that is the only shape that travels.
