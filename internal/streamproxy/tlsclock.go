// 2026, so a box reporting a time before this has an unset clock. SoundTouch
// speakers have no battery-backed RTC: after a cold boot, before NTP has synced
// (or when NTP is blocked), the clock lands in the firmware's build epoch, often
// mid-2015. See and docs/FIRMWARE-NOTES.md.

// literal). It always verifies the certificate chain to the system roots and the
// host, but tolerates a wrong box clock: when the local clock is implausibly
// old, a chain that is valid except for the certificate's time window is still
// accepted. Without this, a speaker whose clock reset to 2015 rejected every
// HTTPS station as "certificate is not yet valid" (Virgin Radio and other
// HTTPS streams would not play, while plain-HTTP BBC streams still did).
//
// Only the expiry/not-yet-valid window is relaxed, and only while the clock is
// untrustworthy; chain-to-root and host are always enforced, so this does not
// weaken MITM protection. host is passed explicitly (not read from
// ConnectionState.ServerName) so a bare-IP upstream, which sends no SNI, is
