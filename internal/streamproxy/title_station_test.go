// The live title is filed under the STATION the user picked, not under the edge
// or media URL a fetch happens to land on.
//
// It used to be filed under the resolved URL: streamOne is called with
// edgeFor(url), and streamOneDepth recurses onto the media URL of a playlist
// pointer, so curTitleURL became the CDN address. The end-of-stream wipe is
// keyed on the station, so the two never matched and the title was never
// cleared. That is coming back through the side door, and it covers most
// real stations: streamtheworld pins an edge host after the first response, and
// an m3u pointer such as Absolut Relax resolves one level deeper again.
