// The bug this pins, measured on real hardware on 2026-09-26.
//
// A SoundTouch answers to TWO ids: the firmware's own, and the one STM's agent
// announces. On an sm2 chassis they DIFFER (three ST10s measured: firmware
// DEV#5e3cac7a vs agent DEV#e2976145 and so on), on scm they are identical (an
// ST30 and a Portable). The desktop app deliberately stores the FIRMWARE id in
// a template member, and the peer roster indexed only the announced one, so the
// guard below compared two names for the same speaker, found them different,
// and refused EVERY group-key press with "another speaker answers at this
// address now" on a LAN where nothing had moved.
//
// Two users reported it as "the thumbs key does nothing" and re-saved the group
// over and over, which could never have helped.
