// The boot guard: after a power cycle, check which Wi-Fi the speaker actually
// came up on and move it back if it is the wrong one.
//
// Why this exists at all. Bose's NetManager keeps its OWN network profile
// store and starts wpa_supplicant from it before STM's agent is even running,
// so the firmware, not STM, decides which network the speaker joins at boot.
// STM's move only ever ADDED the new network to that store, never removed the
// old one, and then measured success as "did an IP address appear" rather than
// "is this the network the user chose". A speaker with both networks in range
// therefore came up on the old one and reported success (proven
// across five diagnostic bundles and seven speakers, 2026-08-21).
//
// The guard runs once per box boot, after NetManager has made its choice, and
// corrects it. It is deliberately timid: it acts only when the speaker IS
// associated (an offline box belongs to run.sh's rescue watchdog, and two
// things pushing an offline box is how you strand it), only when the intended
// network is in the speaker's OWN site survey (so "old network switched off"
// and "moved house" keep working), only while the failure budget lasts, and
// never while a user-initiated switch is running.
