// A saved folder key must survive the music server changing its address.
//
// A queue preset stores the tracks as ABSOLUTE URLs, because that is what the
// speaker has to fetch. Those URLs carry the server's IP, so the day the router
// hands the NAS a different lease, all six keys pointing at it go dead at once
// and nothing says why. The workaround people arrive at is a static lease, and
// it is a fair workaround, but it is one the owner should not have to find:
// STM knows which server the key came from (the preset records its name) and it
// knows where that server lives now (the media-server store, kept current by
// every browse and every discovery round).
//
// Reported on 2026-09-25 in discussion as the third point of an Apple Music
// write-up: "the host device running MinimServer needs a static IP address.
// Without it, router IP reassignments will break the preset keys mapped to the
// playlists."
//
// Same family as, where a media server that moved had to be re-found
// by NAME rather than by the address last seen. This is that lesson applied one
// layer further in, to the URLs already written into a preset.
//
// Deliberately narrow: only the HOST is rewritten, never the port or the path.
// A DLNA server's content port is not always its description port (Synology
// serves descriptions on 50001 and content on 50002), so a port "correction"
// would break working keys to fix a case nobody reported.
