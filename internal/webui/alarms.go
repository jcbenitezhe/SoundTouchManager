// The alarm clock: at a set time on set weekdays, wake the speaker and recall
// one of the six presets. The scheduler runs HERE, on the box, because the
// thing that sets an alarm (a phone, the desktop app) is not awake at 06:30.
//
// Two rules keep it honest, both about the clock rather than the alarm, because
// these speakers have no battery-backed RTC:
//
//  1. Nothing fires while the clock is implausible (clocksync.Implausible), so
//     a box that boots believing it is 2015 rings nothing.
//  2. A due instant more than alarmGrace old is skipped, so a restart at 06:31
//     still wakes you and a box first plugged in at 09:00 stays quiet.
//
// That is deliberately all. An earlier draft also refused to fire for anything
// due before the runner watched the clock become trustworthy, on the principle
// that it should only act on time it had witnessed. It was wrong: once the
// clock IS repaired it is accurate (the HTTP Date header is the true time), so
// "06:30 was two minutes ago" is a fact, not a reconstruction. Rule 2 already
// discards instants from the wrong decade, because they are nowhere near
// alarmGrace old on the corrected clock, and the fired state stops a repeat.
// The extra rule only ever ate a legitimate alarm whose clock repair landed a
// few minutes late - power restored at 06:31 for an 06:30 alarm - which is
// exactly the morning someone wants to be woken.
//
// One thing the two rules cannot do on their own is tell "the agent restarted
// at 06:33" from "the user pressed Save at 06:33". A new alarm has no fired
// record, and a disabled one is never marked, so an alarm added, re-enabled or
// moved inside its own grace window went off at once. The runner therefore
// remembers the document it evaluated last time and, before firing anything,
// acknowledges every alarm the editor just changed: its current due instant is
// recorded exactly as a fire would record it, so its first real fire is the
// next one. A restart takes the stored document as its baseline instead, and
// so still fires the alarm the power cut missed. See acknowledgeAlarmEdits.

	// jumped the clock to the right decade, and the alarm would be silently
	// hours out. Re-deriving the next fire from the wall clock at least twice a
	// minute bounds that damage to one cycle.
	//
	// With nothing scheduled there is nothing to re-derive, so the runner parks
