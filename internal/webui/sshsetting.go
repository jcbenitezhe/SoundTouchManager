// The speaker's SSH port, as something the user can decide rather than a file
// path in a warning message.
//
// Until v0.9.91 a speaker opened SSH on every boot whether anybody wanted it or
// not. That was a bug and it is fixed: the port now stays closed unless a marker
// on NAND says otherwise. But the only way to place that marker was over SSH,
// which is a circle, and the app's warning told people to "remove
// /mnt/nv/remote_services" as though that were an instruction a person could
// follow.
//
// Two users asked for the other direction: they run SSH deliberately
// and want it to stay. Both needs are the same switch.
//
// Scope, deliberately narrow: this manages STM's OWN marker. Bose's
// /mnt/nv/remote_services is somebody else's file and STM does not delete it; it
// is reported instead, because while it is there the port stays open no matter
// what this switch says.
