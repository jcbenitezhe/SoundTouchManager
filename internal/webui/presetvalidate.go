// Is that URL a radio station, or the station's home page?
//
// A field bundle (2026-08-02) carried three presets whose stored URL was the
// station's WEBSITE, e.g. www.radiohamburg.de/. Those save without complaint,
// map onto a hardware key, and can never play: the box fetches the proxy, the
// proxy fetches a web page, and the user is left pressing a dead button with no
// idea why. The save is the only moment where that is cheap to catch.
//
// The check is deliberately ONE-SIDED. It refuses a save only on positive
// evidence that the URL serves a web page; every other outcome, including every
// error, allows the save. That asymmetry is the whole design:
//
//   - A station that is temporarily down, rate-limiting, or behind a slow CDN
//     must still be savable. Refusing there would be a far worse bug than the
//     one this fixes, and it would be intermittent, which is worse again.
//   - Legacy SHOUTcast v1 servers answer "ICY 200 OK" instead of an HTTP status
//     line. Go's net/http rejects that as malformed (the whole class of old
//     stations that PR fixed in the stream proxy, which has its own
//     ICY-rewriting dialer this probe deliberately does not reuse). Here that
//     error simply reads as "inconclusive", so those stations keep saving.
//   - A playlist (.pls/.m3u/.m3u8) is a legitimate target that some servers
//     mislabel as text/html, so playlists skip the probe entirely.

// preset pointing at a LAN stream comes back "could not tell" and saves exactly
// as before. Nothing legitimate is lost, and in exchange the save endpoint stops
// being a way for anyone who can reach the agent's port to make the SPEAKER
// probe arbitrary hosts inside the network. CodeQL flagged that
// (go/request-forgery) the first time this shipped, and it was right to.
