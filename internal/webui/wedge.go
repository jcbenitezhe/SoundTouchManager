// Wedged-control detection.
//
// Field case (SoundTouch 300, 2026-07-09): the box answers :8090, the agent
// runs, presets are accepted — but the speaker blinks its boot pattern, the
// firmware never pulls the stream URL it just accepted and never reaches a
// playing state. Software reboots do not clear it; only a power-cycle does.
// The user cannot tell this state from a normal boot, so STM now detects it
// and says the one thing that helps: pull the plug.
//
// Signal: a recall verify that exhausts its retries while (a) the box is
// awake (not STANDBY — a user power-off mid-recall is not a wedge), (b) the
// box never opened any proxied stream in the window, and (c) no upstream
// stream failure was recorded (that would be a dead STATION, not a dead box).
// Two such strikes in a row latch boxHealth=wedged, surfaced via
// /api/agent/version to the desktop app and the phone remote. Any observed
// playback clears the state.
