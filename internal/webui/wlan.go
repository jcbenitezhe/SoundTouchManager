// Robust across the two Wi-Fi stacks SoundTouch ships (see run.sh's WLAN
// section):
//   - wpa_supplicant boxes (wlan0): the new network is applied LIVE via wpa_cli
//     reconfigure, verified, and rolled back to the previous network if it does
//     not associate, so a wrong password leaves the box on its old Wi-Fi rather
//     than stranded.
//   - BCO boxes (eth0, e.g. Portable): no usable runtime channel exists
//     (wpa_supplicant is absent), so the credentials are persisted and the box
//     reboots to apply them through the proven boot-time provisioning path.
//
// In ALL cases the SSID/PASS are written to the canonical NAND wlan-creds that
// the boot path replays, AND the one-shot apply marker is dropped so the next
// boot actively programs the new network once (the firmware's own profile
// store still holds the old one and wins the boot association otherwise).
// The previous version only wrote a runtime wpa file at the wrong path
// and never updated wlan-creds, so a reboot reverted it AND on BCO boxes it
// poked a non-existent wpa_supplicant and silently did nothing while
// reporting success.
//
// The switch runs in the background and the response returns immediately: the
// box leaves the current network as it switches, so the client must rediscover
// it on the new IP rather than wait on this request. LAN-only so a stray
// internet call can never move the speaker's Wi-Fi.

// SPEAKER can see, which is not the same list as the one the phone or the
// computer sees and is the only list that matters here.
//
// The survey was already being run, but only to REFUSE a switch after the user
// had typed a network in: the app offered the computer's own known networks,
// the user picked one, and the speaker then said it could not see it. That is
// the wrong way round. Asking the speaker first means the user only ever sees
// what is actually reachable, so a network the speaker's radio cannot pick up
// never gets offered in the first place.

// Only on request. The survey puts the radio into a scan for about five
