// verifyRecall confirms the box reached a playing state ON THE EXPECTED STREAM
// shortly after a recall and re-issues the play a few times if not. Fixes the
// "first press after a reboot does nothing, second press works" race
// (box/go-librespot not ready yet) without any latency on the happy path (the
// initial play already ran).
//
// expectedLocation is the box-side URL this recall pushed (e.g.
// boxurl.StreamSlot(slot)). "Busy" alone used to count as success, which hid
// exactly the failure where a racing wake-resume replaced a just-issued
// recall with the PREVIOUS station: the box was playing, just the wrong
// stream. Now a busy box on a different location is re-issued like a silent
// one. Empty expectedLocation keeps the busy-only check.
//
// retry receives lastAttempt=true only on the final try. Spotify uses it to
// re-point the box without a full re-Play on the early tries (a re-Play
// reshuffles and restarts the track), reserving the disruptive re-Play for the
// last-resort recovery. This is the same policy the hardware recall settled on
// in v0.7.4 (cmd/agent verifySpotifyPlaying); routing both through one contract
// keeps the soft and hardware paths from drifting again.
//
// gen is the recall generation returned by this recall's setLastPlay and
// started is when the recall was issued. They feed the stand-down decision
// (verifyStandDownReason): a newer play supersedes this verify (two rapid
// preset presses used to spawn dueling verifies that ping-ponged the stations
// for ~15s), and a deliberate user stop/pause/power-off after `started` ends
// it (the retry used to audibly restart a station the user had just stopped,
// and re-armed the transport of a box the user had just powered off - the
// vector the hardware verifies were already guarded against).
