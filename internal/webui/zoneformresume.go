// masterResumeForZone decides what the master should play again after a group
// change tore its session down, given the box's live now_playing and the last
// stream STM itself pushed.
//
// The rule it replaces was "the box reports a play state, so re-push
// s.lastPlay". That conflates two questions. lastPlay is only ever the last
// stream STM ITSELF pushed: it is written on NAND and read back at start, so it
// survives reboots and can be a week old. A busy box is not proof that the box
// is busy with that stream.
//
// Spotify is where it shows. When the user presses play on the "(STM)" Connect
// entry, the agent points the box at the engine's Ogg proxy directly
// (cmd/agent/main.go, renderer.PlayURLMime of /spotify/stream.ogg) without
// recording it as a play, so lastPlay still holds whatever station ran before.
// Forming a group then dropped the live playlist and started that old station on
// every speaker in the group. Christopher Stark, 2026-09-15, SoundTouch 20 plus
// SoundTouch 10: "wenn auf dem Hauptlautsprecher gerade meine Spotify-Playlist
// laeuft und ich den zweiten Lautsprecher dazunehme, wechseln beide Lautsprecher
// auf das zuletzt gespielte Preset".
//
// The discriminator is the ContentItem LOCATION, not the source name, and it is
// the one the periodic mirror reconcile already uses: slaveMirrorAction compares
// np.Location against the stream URL for exactly this reason, after the
// unguarded version "hijacked a slave's Spotify playback with the master's
// persisted last station every 5 minutes". Forming a zone is the one
// place that guard was never applied.
//
// blocked reports that the master is audibly on something this box cannot push
// at all (Bluetooth, AUX, the box's own Spotify). Then nothing is pushed and no
// other source is substituted: a silent group is recoverable with one key press,
// a group playing last Tuesday's station over a live session is not.
