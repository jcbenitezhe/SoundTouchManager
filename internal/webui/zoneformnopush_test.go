// Forming a TWO-speaker group briefly interrupted the music, while adding the
// 3rd and 4th did not. Measured on a SoundTouch 10 on 2026-09-24: the master
// reported PLAY_STATE 1.5 s after the form, STM pushed the stream anyway, and
// the speaker was silent for about 2.5 s.
//
// The push was made unconditional on a fresh form because skipping it had once
// left freshly joined members silent while the master played on (Martin,
// 2026-08-24). From the master alone those two states are identical, so the
// members are asked now. Every wrong "yes" here is Martin's bug again, which is
// why the predicate is pessimistic about everything it cannot confirm.
