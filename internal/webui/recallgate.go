// recallRefusedBeforeWake answers every precondition for a preset recall that
// can be settled without the speaker, writes the refusal itself, and reports
// whether the caller must stop. It also performs the legacy-preset heal, which
// is why it takes a pointer.
//
// It runs BEFORE the speaker is woken, and that ordering is the whole point.
//
// The firmware resumes whatever it last played when it is powered on, so the
// wake that a recall performs restarts that station a second or so before the
// recall is even evaluated. When the recall was then refused, the user had
// pressed key 1, seen an error on key 1, and was listening to key 6.
// Two releases tried to stop the resumed station again afterwards and both
// lost the race, because the box answers the stop with an HTTP 200 whether or
// not the audio actually stopped. None of these three checks needs an awake
// speaker: an empty track list and an unreplayable saved URI are fields on the
// preset, the engine handle is local state, CanRecall probes the sidecar on
// loopback and reads a file, and the account type is already known. Asked
// here, a doomed recall never sends `sys power`, so there is nothing to undo.
//
// Anything added here must be answerable with the box asleep. A check that
// needs the speaker belongs after the wake, where it always did.
