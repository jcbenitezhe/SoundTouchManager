// Group volume from the phone.
//
// The desktop app can form a group, and until now that was also the only place
// it could be used: to switch the group on or to change how loud it plays, a
// user had to walk to the computer and start it. Three people asked for this on
// the same day, one of them putting it plainly: he has to boot the laptop just
// to turn the volume down while listening.
//
// Two things make this work from a speaker's own web page. The membership comes
// from the PERSISTED zone rather than the firmware's live one, because the
// firmware's zone endpoint answers on some chassis and not on others (measured
// across a nine-speaker fleet: only the three rhino ST10s ever answered, healthy
// or not), while the persisted zone is STM's own record and is always there. And
// the volume calls go to each member's BOSE port, which stays reachable between
// speakers even on the series-I boxes whose agent ports block each other.
