// sdkcloudurls.go: the Bose SDK's cloud URLs, where the firmware reads them
// from, and how a rival mod's leftover value is healed back to stock.
//
// The firmware asks three hosts for everything that used to be the cloud: the
// marge account/preset service, the BMX service registry, and the stats
// endpoint. STM does not talk those hosts out of the box; it redirects the
// STOCK hostnames to its own listeners via /etc/hosts. So a box whose config
// names a DIFFERENT host is invisible to that redirect and silently never
// reaches STM at all: the marge stub sees no request, LOCAL_INTERNET_RADIO is
// never registered, and every preset recall falls back to the dead-cloud path
// and answers 1036 NOT_LOGGED_IN. That is exactly what the ST30 did for
// three days with margeServerUrl pointing at an OpenCloudTouch server
// (http://content.api.bose.io:7777) while STM listened on 9080/443.
//
// Two files carry the values, and the NAND one wins:
//
//	/mnt/nv/OverrideSdkPrivateCfg.xml        NAND, writable, authoritative
//	/opt/Bose/etc/SoundTouchSdkPrivateCfg.xml  rootfs, READ-ONLY (ubifs ro)
//
// usb-stick/install.sh (heal_sdk_cloud_urls) and usb-stick/run.sh already heal
// the override file at install and at every boot, which covers a box that HAS
// one. the box had none: OpenCloudTouch had edited the rootfs copy and
// stashed the pristine original as /mnt/nv/SoundTouchSdkPrivateCfg.xml.oct-backup,
// so the heal's `[ -f ]` gate made it a no-op and the bad URL survived every
// boot, the cleanup button, and a factory reset.
//
// The heal here closes that gap without touching the rootfs (remounting it rw
// is firmware bending and off the table by standing rule): it takes the box's
// OWN SDK config as the template, rewrites the three URL tags to their stock
// values, and writes the result to the NAND override path. Copying a file the
// firmware itself wrote means no schema is invented, which is what makes this
// safe on a variant nobody has measured.
