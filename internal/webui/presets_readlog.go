// The GET /api/presets read log, rate-limited per client.
//
// The empty-answer WARN used to fire on every GET. Two phone remotes polling
// a speaker with an empty store every 15 s wrote 250 lines in 19 minutes,
// which evicted every boot line from the 32 KB NAND log tail a diagnostic
// bundle carries (the one boot the bundle needed to show was gone). One
// line per client per window says the same thing; the count of what was left
// out rides on the next line.
//
// Non-empty answers are the steady state of every healthy box, and the agent
// log is an unbuffered append to NAND, so they must not cost a periodic
// write: a client gets ONE "served" line, on its first read or when the store
// turns from empty to non-empty, and stays silent after that. That one line
// is all a bundle needs to prove the app was handed the list it asked for
// (non-empty reads used to be Debug, invisible in a bundle).
