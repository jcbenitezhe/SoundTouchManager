// The desktop app decides a speaker is ready to play by looking for the
// "version" key in the first bytes of /api/agent/version. The handler built a
// map, encoding/json sorts a map's keys, and every optional flag sorts BEFORE
// "version" and pushed it further right. Measured on live hardware 2026-09-25:
// a healthy speaker put the key at offset 419 to 435 of a 440 to 478 byte body,
// leaving 77 to 93 bytes of headroom against the app's 512-byte read. An
// OpenCloudTouch box emits conflictingMod (33 bytes) and foreignCloudURL (66)
// together, because both have the same cause, so the one speaker the flag was
// added to diagnose answered a body whose version key fell outside the window,
// and every play and preset copy to it was refused as "still starting".
