// The firmware's own setup episodes.
//
// Field case (two independent reporters, rhino ST10, v0.9.74,
// 2026-09-06): after a stick-free network install the speaker comes back with
// STM running and then flips between its out-of-box SETUP source and
// INVALID_SOURCE for several minutes, its Wi-Fi light blinking fast, dropping
// off the LAN at least once. The desktop app sees none of that: from the PC
// the speaker is simply silent, so the install wait times out and reports a
// failure for an install that in fact succeeded.
//
// The agent, running ON the speaker, does see it: the gabbo bus reports the
// source flip and, about five seconds after it, a <setupAPUpdated>true</>
// frame - the firmware saying in its own words that it is raising its setup
// access point. Counting those episodes here is what lets the app say
// afterwards what the speaker was doing during a blackout it could not
// observe.
//
// Deliberately in memory only: no timer, no poll, no NAND write. This runs on
// every speaker STM is installed on, and a counter that costs a flash write is
// not worth a diagnostic (SCHONE die Box-Hardware).
