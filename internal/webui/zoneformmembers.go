// memberCarryBudget bounds the whole "is every member already hearing this?"
// question. It runs inside the post-response goroutine, so it never delays the
// group the user just formed; the budget exists so ONE unreachable member
// cannot hold the recovery push back behind its own timeout.
const memberCarryBudget = 3 * time.Second

// everyMemberCarriesTheGroup reports whether every member is audibly on the
// master's stream already, which is the only state in which skipping the
// post-form re-push is safe.
//
// The re-push exists because a fresh group's members start with nothing, and a
// skip left them silent while the master played on (Martin, 2026-08-24). That
// was fixed by always pushing on a fresh form, and the cost landed on everyone:
// the master IS still playing at that moment, so the push stops a stream nobody
// asked to stop. Measured on a SoundTouch 10 on 2026-09-24: the master reported
// PLAY_STATE 1.5 s after the form, the push went out anyway, and the speaker was
// silent for about 2.5 s.
//
// So the question is asked of the members instead of inferred from the master.
// Deliberately pessimistic, because every wrong "yes" is Martin's bug again:
//
//   - no members at all -> false. A caller that does not know who joined cannot
//     claim they are served.
//   - a member that cannot be read -> false. Unreadable is not "fine"; the
//     historical safe behaviour is to push.
//   - a member that is not in a playing state -> false, even when it reports
//     GROUP_SLAVE. A follower sitting in STOP_STATE is exactly the silent
//     member this guard exists to catch.
//   - a member on something of its own -> false.
//
// Only a member that is BOTH playing and on the group's audio counts as served.
