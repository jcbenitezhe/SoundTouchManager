// it through api(), which collapses every non-2xx to null, so playSlot saw
// nothing but failure and showed "Could not start / tap again" - in the
// now-playing line, which the 5 s status poll then overwrote. The reporter
// described exactly that: the key highlights, un-highlights, and no error
// message appears, while the speaker's own log carried the reason four times.
