// six to seven seconds of silence between folder tracks.
//
// Timed against the same Synology folder played twice on one ST20, once driven
// by STM and once by the box itself: 157 s against 150 s, and 236 s against
// 230 s. The box's own advance is 0.8 s, which is why the Bose app sounds
// gapless and STM does not.
//
// The chassis finishes a file and freezes in PLAY_STATE at EOF instead of
// emitting STOP, so the STOP branch never runs and every track ends on the
// wall-clock net at end + queueTimerMargin.
//
// Those six seconds are a grace for a box that reports NO position: with nothing
// to corroborate the length against, cutting a buffering track short is the
// worse failure. A box that reports a position AND reports it sitting at the end
// has already said the track is over.
