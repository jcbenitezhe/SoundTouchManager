// The wake resume decides inside a TIME budget, and this file pins it.

// The power-off bounce guard is a 6 s window measured from the moment STM
// saw the box drop UPNP -> STANDBY (standbyBounceWakeWindow). ResumeLastPlay was
// written to spend 2 s of that budget on its settle sleep, which is what the
// window's own comment sizes it against. Anything else the goroutine does BEFORE
// that guard spends the same budget, and a box read is the one kind of work that
// can spend seconds of it without looking like it does.

// timeout the guard is already past 6 s when it is finally consulted, so STM
