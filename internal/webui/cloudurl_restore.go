// handleRestoreCloudURL puts STM back in charge of the speaker's cloud address.
//
// Why this exists next to handleRemoveConflictingMod: that one cleans up the
// FILES another tool left behind. This is the other shape, and it is the one a
// rival app causes while it is simply running.
//
// Measured on a five-speaker fleet on 2026-09-26, minutes after the ST Remote
// Pro iOS app was started for the first time: every speaker's LIVE margeURL had
// become https://stremotepro.com/api/bose-cloud, every speaker restarted, and
// afterwards none of them was paired with STM any more, so the six hardware
// keys were dead. The override file on NAND was untouched and still correct.
//
// That is the whole trap. The repair path STM had rewrites the file, the file
// was never wrong, so it healed nothing and then reported success. The firmware
// reads that file once, at boot, so the actual cure is a restart, and it works:
// all five came back stock and paired after one reboot each.
//
// This endpoint therefore does the file half (a no-op on the common shape) and
// reports honestly whether a restart is what is still owed. The restart itself
// is left to the caller, so the desktop app can sequence a whole fleet and
// verify each speaker afterwards instead of every box rebooting at once.
