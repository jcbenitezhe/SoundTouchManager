// Taking ONE speaker out of a saved permanent group.
//
// Until now the only control a saved group had was the x on its own frame,
// which deletes the whole thing. That gap became visible when the stereo
// section started telling people why it could not pair: "remove two of them
// from their group first, then pair them" - advice nothing in the app could
// carry out. An owner of six SoundTouch 10s, all of them in two saved groups,
// was told to do something that did not exist.
//
// A saved group is only a document. Its master is idle and its members report
// nothing, so there is no firmware zone to take apart and no speaker to wake:
// this edits the stored membership and nothing else. That is why it is a
// separate endpoint rather than a flag on the dissolve, which drives the
// firmware and would wake the group to change it.
//
// DELETE /api/box/zone/member?ip=<addr>        (or ?deviceID=<id>)
//
// The last member is the end of the group: a group of one is not a group, so
// the document is cleared rather than left as a master with nobody in it.
