//
// Juergen's eleven-speaker fleet, 2026-09-14: a seven-box group on a
// SoundTouch 30 master. Nine dissolve attempts, four retries each, every one
// answered without an error and every re-read of the zone came back with all
// six members. The app said the group was gone, the speakers kept playing
// together, and only pulling the master's power ended it. Every teardown on
// the user-driven path posts at the MASTER, and a master in this state is
// exactly the one speaker that will not act on it.
//
// Two things are tried, cheapest first, and the zone is re-read after each:
//
//  1. One member per call instead of all of them in one body. The firmware
//     takes the whole list in a single POST, and a member it dislikes anywhere
//     in that list can take the rest down with it; one at a time at least
//     frees the others and names the one that sticks.
//  2. The teardown posted AT EACH FOLLOWER. dissolvesweep.go has used this for
//     stale memberships since it was written, with the comment that a teardown
//     at the master is a no-op once the master's firmware has stopped
//     cooperating. That is this case, and the user-driven dissolve never got
//     to use it.
//
// Returns the members the master still reports, and the still-unreadable
// reason if the zone could not be re-read.
