// zoneFormBudget is how long the whole form is allowed to take, as a function

// user dropped, the /setZone drive itself, and the read that confirms it. The

// ceiling on group size rather than a safety net.
//
// A twelve-speaker household measured it exactly on 2026-08-08, adding one
// speaker at a time and waiting between each:
//
//	1 to 5 slaves   formed in 4 to 8 seconds
//	6 slaves        formed, but took 22 seconds
//	7 slaves        failed every time, always "setZone: context deadline
//	                exceeded", five attempts in a row
//

// of twelve earlier that afternoon, when the box happened to answer quickly.
// The owner's conclusion was that STM cannot do more than six, which is exactly
// what a fixed budget looks like from outside.
