// Silencing the speaker before a large OTA transfer.
//
// An update pushes two ARM binaries over the speaker's Wi-Fi: the agent (~12 MB)
// and the Spotify engine (~16 MB). On a SoundTouch that transfer runs at roughly
// 150 KB/s and occupies the box for a minute or two, and the speaker has to
// serve the audio stream through the same radio and the same modest CPU at the
// same time.
//
// It loses. A field bundle from 2026-08-06 catches it exactly: the engine upload
// starts, and 44 seconds in the box gives up on the stream it was playing with
// AUDIO_ERROR_BAD_URL, flaps UPNP -> INVALID_SOURCE, gets resumed by the re-push
// machinery two seconds later, and drops again. The owner described it as the
// stream "stopping/starting when playing after update", and noted it was gone
// after a cold reboot, which is simply the state where no transfer is running.
//
// Fighting for the bandwidth is the wrong answer, because the update needs it
// and the listener cannot have both. So the speaker is quietened first: the
// transfer gets the box to itself, and instead of a minute of broken audio and
// firmware errors the speaker simply goes quiet for the update, which is what a
// speaker doing an update is expected to do.
//
// Scope is deliberately narrow. Only what STM itself is driving gets stopped.
// A speaker playing Bluetooth, AUX or its own native Spotify is left alone: the
// transfer will disturb that too, but reaching in and silencing a source STM
// does not own is a bigger intrusion than the stutter it prevents.
