// queuelog.go gives the library play queue a record of what it did.
//
// a folder stopped part way through and the diagnostic bundle could not
// say why, because every moment in the queue's life was silent. The start wrote
// no line, neither did an advance, the exhausted branch, or any of the seven
// places that stop a queue, and there was no debug section either. In a log
// "the folder finished", "the watcher gave up on a track that never started"
// and "somebody pressed stop" were the same thing: nothing.
//
// The record is deliberately small and free of track titles. Counters and
// indices answer the question that is actually asked ("did it play 3 of 12 or
// 12 of 12, and what ended it"), and a bundle posted in a public issue then
// carries no one's file names. It lives in memory only: nothing here touches
// NAND.

// queueEpisodeKeep is how many finished episodes the debug section keeps. Five
// covers the usual "it stopped again, here is a fresh bundle" round trip
// without the section growing unbounded on a box that plays all day.
