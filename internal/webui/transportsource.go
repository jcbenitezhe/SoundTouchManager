// Pause and Stop have to reach whatever is actually playing.
//
// STM's transport controls drive the UPnP renderer, and for most of this
// project's life that was right: STM pushed the audio, so the UPnP transport
// WAS the playback. Native radio presets changed that. A native station is
// fetched by the speaker itself and runs on the box's own player, with the
// active source reading LOCAL_INTERNET_RADIO. A UPnP Pause then acts on an idle
// transport: it succeeds, reports success, and the music keeps playing.
//
// That is what a reporter described on 2026-08-06 without knowing the cause:
// "starting stations works, volume works, AUX and Bluetooth work, but Pause and
// Stop have no effect." His bundle shows source=LOCAL_INTERNET_RADIO,
// playStatus=PLAY_STATE and every port reachable, which rules out the speaker
// being unwell and leaves only the wrong addressee.
//
// So the control follows the source: UPNP keeps the renderer path exactly as it
// was, and anything the box plays itself gets a remote key instead, which is
// what the physical remote sends.
