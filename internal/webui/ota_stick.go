// OTA stick refresh.
//
// run.sh's boot sync is deliberately unconditional: a stick that is inserted
// at boot wins, every time - its agent binary is copied over the NAND cache
// with no version check ("what I just put on the stick is what the box runs").
// That model breaks the HTTP-OTA when the install stick was simply left in the
// speaker: the OTA writes the new binary to NAND, the post-OTA reboot runs the
// stick->NAND sync, and the stick's OLD binary silently reverts the update.
// The box then keeps reporting the old version, the desktop app pushes the
// update again, and the user sees an update that never sticks (three
// installs and four reboots for one v0.9.5 update).
//
// The desktop app already rewrites a still-inserted stick over SSH before the
// push (ota.go refreshStick), but SSH is stick-gated and often closed, and the
// stick can be unmountable from outside. The agent runs ON the box and needs
// neither: after the NAND write succeeds, refreshStickAgentBinary puts the
// same bytes onto the stick so the boot sync installs the NEW version. Both
// paths are best-effort and idempotent (identical content is skipped), so
// they complement rather than fight each other.

// refreshStickAgentBinary writes the freshly OTA'd agent binary onto a
// still-inserted STM stick, atomically (temp + rename) and flushed to the
// device, so the next boot's unconditional stick->NAND sync installs the same
// version instead of reverting the OTA. Called on the post-OTA reboot path,
// BEFORE the reboot command, so the write always completes first. Best-effort:
// a stickless box or a failed write only logs; the NAND update stands either
// way (it just will not survive the next boot with a stale stick inserted).

	// sync copies the OLD binary back over NAND - the very loop this exists

	// the stick, so detaching the stick device does not kill it, and the reboot
