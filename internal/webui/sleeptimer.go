// Sleep timer: switch this speaker, or the whole group, off after a while.
//
// Two rules shape the whole design.
//
// The FIRST is that deep standby is sacred. A sleep timer sounds like the
// opposite of a keep-awake feature, and it is, but it is trivially easy to
// build one that keeps a speaker up: poll the box every minute to show a
// countdown, or fire a power-off into a box that fell asleep on its own and
// wake it doing so. So the timer never touches the speaker while it runs (it is
// a Go timer, nothing more), and when it fires it READS the source first and
// stands down if the speaker is already in standby. Nothing here may ever be
// the reason a speaker is awake.
//
// The SECOND is that it does not survive an agent restart, deliberately. Making
// it persistent would mean a NAND write every time somebody sets it, and the
// failure it protects against is "the speaker does not fall asleep", which is
// the harmless direction. A speaker that reboots at 3am and then stays on until
// morning is a far smaller problem than one extra flash write per bedtime.

// Seams for the tests. The two box calls below reach the firmware on a fixed
// port (:8090), so a test server on a random port can never be reached through
// them: without these, every test would silently take the "cannot read it,
// stand down" path and prove nothing about the decision it claims to test.
// Production always uses the real implementations.
