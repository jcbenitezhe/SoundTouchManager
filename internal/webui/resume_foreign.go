// Foreign-content guard for the automatic power-on resume.
//
// The DO_NOT_RESUME restore that drives ResumeLastPlay is not only sent on a
// power-on. The firmware sends the identical frame when it tears STM's UPnP
// source down, and one of the ways it does that is a failed skip: the box
// cannot skip a UPnP source, answers QPLAY_SKIP_*_FAILED and drops the source
// (see webui.HardwareSkip and internal/boxws). During that drop the box reports
// no play state at all, so the busy check ResumeLastPlay relies on reads "awake
// and idle" and the resume pushes STM's last station.
//
// That is harmless while the speaker is STM's. It is not harmless when somebody
// is streaming to the speaker from something else: pressing Next on the remote
// during a Music Assistant stream made the speaker jump to an STM station, which
// the reporter described as the speaker wanting to switch presets (Christian1985l,
// discussion).
//
// boxws now suppresses the wake for the skip it can see on the bus. This is the
// second, independent half: whatever the frame claimed, a speaker that is
// carrying content STM does not serve belongs to whoever put it there, and the
// automatic resume stands down.
//
// Freshness is part of the test, not an extra. A ContentItem alone says what the
// box is TUNED to, not what is happening now: the firmware restores the last
// selection when it comes out of standby, so a user whose evening ended on Music
// Assistant is still carrying that foreign item the next morning. Standing down
// on it would silently turn the power-on resume off for that user for good, with
// one log line to show for it. So the stand-down needs the item AND a live play
// status in the same reading (PLAY / BUFFERING / PAUSE): that is a speaker
// somebody is using right now. A restored selection on a box that reports no
// play state is history, and the resume proceeds.
