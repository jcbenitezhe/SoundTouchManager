// Reading a native LOCAL_INTERNET_RADIO location back.
//
// OrionStationLocation (lir.go) is how STM writes a station for the speaker:
// base64 JSON in a "/station?data=" location, with the stream and the artwork
// pointing at this agent's own proxies because the speaker fetches both itself.
// When the speaker hands such a location BACK (its own hold-to-store gesture
// PUTs the playing item to marge, its /presets list reports the slot), the
// agent has to recover what the station actually is: the origin stream and
// the origin image, not the loopback wrappers. This is the one place that
// unwinds them, so the marge keeper and the reconcile agree on the answer.

// 2026-09-13: key 6 held a station on the follower the recall went to and
// nothing on the master, the master fetched its own /stream/6, its proxy
// answered "box fetched a slot with no playable preset slot=6 found=false", and
// the user got a solid amber LED and silence on all three. The same keys played
// as soon as the group was undone.

// Naming the follower's own LAN address instead is not the way out: two rhino
// ST10s cannot reach each other's web port at all, so the master's fetch would
// simply fail differently. The raw form carries the station in the URL, so
// whichever speaker ends up fetching resolves it against its own proxy and no
