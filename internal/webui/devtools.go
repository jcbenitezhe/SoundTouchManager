// Development-only endpoints.
//
// Most of /api/debug is read-only and belongs on every speaker: it is what a
// diagnostic bundle is built from. Two endpoints are not read-only and must not
// be reachable on a user's speaker:
//
//   - /api/debug/native-preset-probe REMOVES and rewrites preset slots while it
//     works out which command shape the firmware accepts. It restores them
//     afterwards, but a call that is interrupted leaves a hardware key dead.
//   - /api/debug/marge-lab redirects the speaker's whole cloud conversation to
//     another machine on the LAN.
//
// Both are harnesses built for one test bench. On port 8888 they are reachable
// from anywhere on the owner's network, so they are off unless deliberately
// switched on, and they answer 404 rather than 403 so a scan cannot even tell
// they exist.
//
// Enable with the environment variable STM_DEV_TOOLS=1 (the agent is launched
// from the on-NAND run script, so this is a deliberate act), or by placing a
// marker file at /mnt/nv/stmanager/devtools - the same opt-in-by-marker shape
// the SSH access uses.
