//
//	17:59:13.454  source changed  LOCAL_INTERNET_RADIO -> LOCAL
//	17:59:15.539  re-push: box dropped the stream while idle, resuming
//	17:59:15.674  source changed  LOCAL -> UPNP
//
// The busy check could not catch it, because the Wave's own tuner reports no
// PLAY_STATE: it is not a transport the firmware exposes. So the source has to
// be consulted as well.
