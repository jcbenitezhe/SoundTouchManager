// Dissolving a group has to reach every speaker that is playing because of it.
//
// The teardown drives the MASTER's firmware: RemoveZoneSlave, repeated until the
// master reports an empty zone. That covers every member the master actually
// registered, and misses the ones it never did.
//
// Those exist. A field bundle from 2026-08-06 shows a group formed with
//
//	requested:2  verified:1  missing:[DEV#...]  ok:true
//
// The speaker in `missing` got audio all the same, because the mirror path
// pushes the stream to it directly. When the group was dissolved it was not in
// the master's member list, nothing told it to stop, and it kept playing in an
// empty room. The owner reported exactly that: "when the group was dissolved the
// Wave carried on playing."
//
// The rule here is deliberately narrow. Silencing a speaker that is meanwhile
// playing something ELSE would be a worse bug than the one being fixed, so a
// straggler is only stopped when it is demonstrably still carrying the group's
// content: same now-playing location as the master had at the moment the
// dissolve started. Anything else is left alone.

// stopStragglers silences group members that are still carrying the master's
// content after the firmware teardown. A member is a straggler when it is still
// playing the GROUP's stream, which it can report in either of two shapes:
//
//   - native: its now-playing location equals masterLocation, what the master
//     itself was playing when the dissolve began (the 2026-08-06 missing-member
//     case, where the master pushed the stream to a box it never registered).
//   - mirror: its location's host:port equals mirrorHostPort, the master's mirror
//     proxy (masterIP:17008) that every mirror slave was pointed at. A mirror
//     group has NO firmware zone, so the RemoveZoneSlave loop is a no-op and this
//     is the ONLY thing that stops the followers. masterLocation can never match
//     here: the master reports its own loopback 127.0.0.1:8888/stream/N while the
//     slaves carry masterIP:17008/stream/N, so the old exact-string compare left
//     every mirror follower playing after a "dissolve" (field: the group kept
//     playing). Comparing host:port is exactly the test slaveMirrorAction already
//     uses to recognise a slave on the master's stream.
//
// Two more shapes, both from a field bundle of 2026-09-07 (three speakers
// playing a music library, the firmware dropped the two followers out of the
// zone by itself, and both played on in their rooms while every app showed
// them in standby):
//
//   - same server: the master plays a music-library TRACK, and its location
//     moves on to the next track every few minutes. A follower that dropped out
//     keeps the track it had, so the exact compare fails although it is
//     audibly still on the group's programme. A follower whose location sits on
//     the same host:port as the master's (the media server) is therefore a
//     straggler too. Loopback hosts are excluded from this rule on purpose: a
//     member on 127.0.0.1:8888 plays its OWN proxy, and equality already covers
//     a zone slave mirroring the master's loopback item.
//   - still a slave: a member that reports the GROUP_SLAVE source has, by its
//     own account, nothing of its own playing. Whatever its location says, it
//     is carrying the group's audio.
//
// The master location empty AND no mirror proxy disables the sweep: without
// something to compare against, stopping speakers on a guess is not worth the
// risk. Anything matching none of the shapes moved on to something of its own
// and is deliberately left alone.
