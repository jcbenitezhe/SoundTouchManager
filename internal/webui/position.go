// the truth. Radio has no end, and the box then reports a duration of zero;
// that is not an error, it is the "position known, length unknown" case, and
// the UI shows elapsed time without a bar. A firmware that does not implement
// the query at all answers ok=false and the UI shows nothing, exactly as before.
