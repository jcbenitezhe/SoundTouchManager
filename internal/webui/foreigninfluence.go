// foreigninfluence.go: one place that says what OTHER tools have done to this
// speaker, and which of it STM can take back.
//
// Why it exists, in Jens' words on 2026-09-26: users try several tools, and
// they keep trying them, and afterwards nobody can tell which tool caused which
// effect. STM should be the safe haven that shows every foreign effect and
// every leftover, and offers to undo it.
//
// The same day proved how invisible this can be. The ST Remote Pro iOS app
// pointed five speakers at its own cloud, and it did so WITHOUT TOUCHING A
// SINGLE FILE: the override on NAND still read stock, only the running firmware
// named the other host. Every file-based check STM had said the speakers were
// clean. A restart wipes that evidence completely, so a bundle taken the next
// day would have shown nothing at all.
//
// Hence two jobs here, not one:
//
//  1. Collect the findings for the app, each with an honest verdict on whether
//     STM can undo it and how.
//  2. Log a change the moment it is seen, on a STABLE, GREPPABLE prefix, so the
//     agent log on NAND carries a timeline that survives the reboot. That log
//     ships in every diagnostic bundle, which is what lets a later sweep search
//     across users for "who else has been here" instead of guessing.
//
// Deliberately NOT a new file on NAND. The log already persists and already
// travels; a second store would be more writes on hardware that is meant to be
// spared (see the standing rule about box wear).
