// LOCAL_INTERNET_RADIO station descriptor.
//
// Bose's own LIR adapter was a stateless shim: the box fetched a small JSON
// document and played the streamUrl inside it, with no account and no login.
// That is the one native radio path whose ContentItem carries no
// sourceAccount, so it cannot fail the not-logged-in check that breaks our
// UPNP presets (1036). This endpoint serves that document for a preset slot,
// pointing at the slot's own stream-proxy URL, so a preset stored as
//
//	<ContentItem source="LOCAL_INTERNET_RADIO" type="stationurl"
//	             location="http://127.0.0.1:8888/lir/<slot>.json" ...>
//
// can be activated by the BOX itself.
//
// Experimental: on firmware 27.0.6 the LIR source is missing from the box's
// source registry (POST /select answers 1005 UNKNOWN_SOURCE_ERROR), so this
// only pays off if the box's own preset activation takes a different path
// than /select, or on a chassis that still has the source. Harmless
// regardless: an unused read-only endpoint.
