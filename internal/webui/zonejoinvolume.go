// A speaker that JOINS a group starts at the group's volume.
//
// Until now nothing set it at all: the joiner kept whatever level it happened
// to have, and since every add path wakes it first and the firmware brings a
// speaker out of standby at its own default (~30, see cmd/agent/wshandler.go),
// adding a speaker to a quiet evening group regularly made one speaker shout.
//
// Three things this deliberately does NOT do, each one paid for before:
//
//   - It touches ONLY the members that are actually joining. The group slider
//     is relative on purpose: writing one absolute number to every
//     member destroys the per-speaker balance a user dialled in, and one added
//     speaker must not flatten the whole room.
//   - It does not re-assert on a timer. Removed exactly that kind of
//     blind restore after it was caught pushing a level DOWN over a user's own
//     correction: a control that cannot tell whose intent it is enforcing
//     should not enforce one. The single follow-up write here stands down the
//     moment it sees a level it did not write.
//   - It does not write through the member's :8090 when the member runs STM.
//     A raw Bose volume PUT landing during a play-start kills the play (a
//     documented firmware flaw, and the reason internal/spotify/volume.go
//     prefers the agent). The write goes to the member's own agent, which
//     serializes it behind that box's command lock.
