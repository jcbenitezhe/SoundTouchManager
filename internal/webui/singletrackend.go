// A single library track played on its own never ended.
//
// The Bose box emits no native "track finished" event, and on a finite file it
// finishes the bytes and then sits in PLAY_STATE with its position frozen at
// the end instead of reporting STOP. A FOLDER survives that, because the
// queue watcher polls and calls the end itself. A lone track had nothing
// watching it at all: handlePlay stops the queue by design, so the app, the
// remote and the speaker's own display all kept showing it playing until the
// auto-off timer cut in twenty minutes later.
//
// Reported on a 2:07 track that the app still showed playing six and a half
// minutes on. The reply that thread got explained a MIME-less track
// going through the stream proxy, which was a different play: this one went
// direct, as audio/x-flac, and stalled for this reason instead.
//
// So give the lone track the same end detection the queue has, without giving
// it a queue: no queue state, no transport controls, no queue card. It reuses
// the queue watcher's own primitives, which are the vetted ones, and it stops
// the box rather than advancing.
//
// It runs only while one finite file plays and exits when that file ends, so it
// adds no standing timer to a box that is idle or on radio.

// singleTrackMaxWatch caps the whole watch. A track longer than this is
// unusual enough (a DJ set, an audiobook chapter) that guessing its end is
// worse than leaving it alone, and the cap means a stuck poll can never leave
// a goroutine reading the box forever.
