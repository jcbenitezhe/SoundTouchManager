// A group can end without anybody pressing "dissolve": the master's firmware
// drops followers that stop answering (a follower on a bad Wi-Fi minute) and
// reports the zone gone. Nothing then tells those followers to stop, and a
// follower that reconnects a moment later carries on with the programme it
// had, alone in its room, while its own state says STANDBY to every app.
//
// A field bundle of 2026-09-07 shows exactly that on two ST10s: the master
// (a music library) dropped them three times in fifteen minutes, both played
// on, and the owner's report was "the speakers play although they are not
// grouped; the app shows them in standby". The only sweep that existed ran on
// the user's own dissolve, and by then the followers were on the track before
// the master's and read as "playing something else".
//
// So a firmware dissolve schedules the same straggler sweep, delayed and
// re-checked: the firmware also announces a dissolve on its way THROUGH a
// group change (/setZone tears the old zone down first), and a sweep fired at
// that moment would silence members the re-form is about to serve. Each pass
// therefore waits, then runs only while the stored document is unchanged, the
// firmware still reports no zone, and no form/dissolve drive holds the serial.
