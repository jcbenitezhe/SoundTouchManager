// Auto-resume crash-loop guard.
//
// The power-on resume and the reconnect recovery re-push the persisted
// last-play stream automatically, with no user action involved. When that
// very stream is what crashes the box (a SoundTouch 20 was reported playing
// distorted audio for a few seconds and then watchdog-rebooting), each boot
// auto-resumes the same stream and the box loops forever: boot -> resume ->
// crash -> watchdog reboot. The only way out was SSH surgery (move rc.local
// aside, delete last-play.json).
//
// The guard breaks that loop: every automatic resume attempt is counted and
// persisted to NAND (inside last-play.json, so it survives the reboot the
// crash causes). Attempts only count as consecutive while they happen within
// autoResumeAttemptWindow of each other - a crash loop produces attempts
// minutes apart, while ordinary resumes are hours apart. After
// maxAutoResumeAttempts consecutive attempts that never reached stable
// playback, the automatic paths stand down and the box stays idle.
//
// The guard resets itself three ways:
//   - stability: the agent surviving autoResumeStableAfter past an attempt
//     with no further attempt proves the resume did not crash the box
//     (a crash reboots the whole box, killing the agent long before the
//     timer fires);
//   - a fresh play (setLastPlay): the user starting anything - preset key,
//     app, queue - is an explicit "play this", and it may well be a
//     different stream;
//   - decay: once the window has passed with no attempt, one new attempt is
//     allowed again (counted from 1). A crash loop thus degrades to at most
//     one reboot per window instead of a tight loop, and a box whose crash
//     was transient heals itself without user action.
