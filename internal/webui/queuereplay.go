// Replaying a Recently-played folder card as a whole folder again.
//
// A folder played as an auto-advancing queue is recorded as ONE Recently-played
// card, and that card stores the FIRST track's URL as its replay target
// (queueplay.go). For the cover and the "what was this" line that is right. For
// the replay button it was quietly wrong: both clients sent that single URL
// through the single-track play path, which clears the queue by design, so the
// folder played its first song, nothing advanced, and the speaker stopped with
// the indicator sitting amber.
//
// Reported on 2026-09-26 against v0.9.87 in discussion by the same person
// who had already had the MIME half of this replay fixed. It is a
// different defect from that one: the track that plays is correct, it is the
// eleven after it that never arrive.
//
// The card key is the folder's identity: "queue:<server UDN>:<container id>",
// written by the desktop app when it starts the queue. So the cure is to browse
// that container again and start a real queue from it. Doing that here rather
// than in the desktop app is what also gives the PHONE remote a folder replay,
// which it never had: the phone cannot browse a NAS itself, which is why its
// replay button went through the same single-URL path.

// Neither half is colon-free, which is what makes this more than a Cut. A UDN is

// a FRITZ!Box names its pop folder "4:cont2:578:AVM GmbH0:3:Pop". Splitting on
// the last colon put the whole id but its final word into the UDN and asked the
// speaker for a server called "...:3", which answered as "not a registered music
// source". Found on a live FRITZ!Box on 2026-09-26, after the unit tests passed
// on a key shaped the way I assumed ids are shaped.
//
// So the split is made against the servers this speaker actually knows, which is
// exact, and only falls back to a guess when none of them matches. That fallback
// still has to be right for the useful case (an unregistered server answers 404
// either way, but the log line should name the real UDN).
