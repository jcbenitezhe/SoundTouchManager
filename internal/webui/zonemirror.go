// Zone-mirror reconcile guards and dissolve propagation.
//
// The 5-minute PeriodicZoneReconcile used to re-push the master's persisted
// lastPlay to every mirror slave unconditionally. Two real-world failures:
// a master sitting in STANDBY sprayed its stale last stream onto slaves that
// were busy playing something else (a Spotify playlist was yanked back to the
// master's old radio station every 5 minutes), and a healthy mirroring slave
// was re-pushed anyway, re-buffering its stream every tick. The pure decision
// helpers here make the reconcile repair only what is actually broken; the
// purge endpoint lets a dissolving master clear the group from every member's
// persisted store, so a forgotten zones.json cannot keep re-asserting a group
// the user tore down (both directions of a stale mutual group were seen in
// the wild).
