// POST /api/box/balance, the write half of the balance endpoint.
//
// Background, because the shape of these tests follows from it: the balance was
// read-only from v0.9.35 until 2026-09-10, and the reason given was that the
// firmware accepts no write. That was measured, and it was measured only over
// HTTP. gesellix found that Bose's own client on the speaker sends it on the
// gabbo WebSocket, so the write now goes there and this endpoint is the front
// door for it.
//
// The box host is unroutable here, as everywhere else in this package, so the
// firmware reads fail and what is pinned is what the handler decides on its
// own. The one thing the handler must never do is report a write it could not
// make: a slider that snaps back is a nuisance, a slider that lies about having
// moved sends the user looking for a fault in their speakers.
