// Pairing into silence: the master was in standby from a preceding
// dissolve, the partner was audibly playing a preset, and formStereoPair drove
// /addGroup with no wake and no resume capture. The firmware synced the fresh
// pair to the standby master, dragged the playing partner into standby one
// second after pairing (partner log 2026-08-24 18:50:39), and the user reported
// "stereo werkt niet" although both /addGroup calls had succeeded. These tests
// pin the two new pieces: the partner capture (what the pair should play when
// only the partner was playing) and the resume guard semantics that let a
// partner-derived capture actually fire on a master that never played.
