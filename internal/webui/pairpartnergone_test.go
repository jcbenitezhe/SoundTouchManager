// A speaker that is half of a stereo pair whose partner is gone is healthy,
// reachable and answers everything, and still cannot play a single thing: the
// firmware refuses every source activation while a pair is incomplete and drops
// straight back to standby five seconds later. Without this field the app can
// only say "the speaker is not responding", which sends the owner looking at his
// speaker, his network and his presets. Measured 2026-09-29: the partner had
// been off the network since 11 September and the owner pressed over eighty
// times.
//
// The shape is asserted on the document itself rather than through the handler,
// which needs a live box on :8090. A handler test here would pass on its error
// path without ever reaching the field, which is worse than no test.
