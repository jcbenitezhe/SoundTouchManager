// The permanent ("default") group. A firmware zone dies with every reboot and
// every standby, and the persisted zone document (internal/zones) so far fed
// only the guarded mirror re-push and an opt-in native tick that stayed off
// (zoneReconcileEnabled). This file makes the document what users keep asking
// for (mail 2026-08-04; again 2026-08-26): the group the user formed IS
// the default group, and whenever its master starts music, the master re-forms
// it and wakes the stored members.
//
// The trigger is the play kick (kickMirrorAfterPlay), never a timer: an idle
// fleet is never touched, and the objection that killed the periodic native
// re-assert (solo speakers dragged back into the group every five minutes,
// Albrecht/Michal 2026-06-19) is answered by classifyMemberForRejoin below: a
// member that is deliberately playing its own source, or that belongs to
// another group, stays out. Dissolving the group deletes the document, which
// is the opt-out. Waking members on a play is sanctioned by design (
// 2026-08-26); preventing their later standby stays forbidden
// (feedback_never_prevent_deep_sleep) and nothing here holds a member awake.
