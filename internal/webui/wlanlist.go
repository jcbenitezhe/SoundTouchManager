// Which networks is this speaker actually configured for?
//
// The theory this exists to test: a speaker that keeps joining the guest
// network is not misbehaving, it simply has more than one network configured
// and picks whichever it sees first. Plausible, repeatedly suspected, and until
// now not testable from a diagnostic bundle at all.
//
// Two things had to be learned before it could be answered.
//
// The bundle read /mnt/nv/wpa_supplicant.conf while the code that writes the
// file uses /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf, so every bundle ever collected carried
// "no such file or directory" for this and nobody noticed. Fixed separately.
//
// And even the right file is not the answer on every chassis. On a rhino ST10
// (live, 2026-08-05) /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf is the untouched vendor template
// with NO network block at all, while the speaker is happily on Wi-Fi. It runs
// with update_config=1 and a control interface, which means the network was
// added at runtime through wpa_cli and never written back to disk. So the file
// tells you what was persisted, and the control interface tells you what the
// speaker is actually using. Both are worth having, and they disagree.
//
// The data arrived, and it moved the answer. Five bundles, seven speakers,
// 2026-08-21: fileBlocks=0 on every single one while wpa_cli listed two to
// four live networks. The on-disk conf is not the candidate list at boot — the
// FIRMWARE's own profile store is, and NetManager injects it into the running
// supplicant over the control interface. Which is why this file now reports
// that store on EVERY chassis, not only on the ones without wpa_cli: until
// today no rhino/sm2 bundle had ever carried the one list that decides which
// network a speaker wakes up on.
//
// Still read-only. Removing a network from the firmware's store is a way to
// lock a speaker out of the only network it can reach, so the correction runs
// through the live supplicant instead (wlanguard.go), where a failure is
// recoverable and a reboot undoes it.
