// zone apart with Ungroup must leave the saved one alone: it forms itself again
// when its main speaker next plays, and a user who presses Ungroup for the
// evening has not asked to throw the group away.
//
// The guard existed on every other path that clears the store, the peer purge
// and the standby doubt clear, and not on the one behind the button. It took a
// stored group off the maintainer's own fleet during a test on 2026-09-03, and
// it is the first thing a reporter suspects when a group is missing after an
// update, which is how it surfaced again on 2026-09-09.
