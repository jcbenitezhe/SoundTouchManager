// trackMime is the MIME a library track is handed to the phone page with.
//
// It decides more than it looks like it does. An empty MIME sends the track
// through the endless-radio stream proxy instead of straight at the speaker
// (playback.go, playDirect), and the proxy has no end: a finite file then plays
// to its last byte and nothing stops, no progress bar is drawn, and the play is
// filed in Recently played as a radio station so replaying it fails the same
// way. Three reports, one reporter, one missing field.
//
// Plenty of servers simply do not put a MIME in protocolInfo, so the file
// extension is the fallback. mimeFromURL returns "" for anything it does not
// recognise, which keeps today's behaviour for a URL with no usable extension
// rather than guessing a codec the speaker would then fail to decode.
