// agent deliberately leaves a pair alone unless the caller says it means the
// pair, so the button asked for the one thing the agent refuses. A reporter
// pressed it thirty times against a live pair, saw nothing happen and nothing
// said, and undid the pair from the desktop app in the end.

// omits the flag, which is exactly what happened. So the caller is pinned here.
