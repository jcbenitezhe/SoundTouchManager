//
// Forming a group of idle speakers made music come out of the one that ended up
// leading it. Traced on shorty310's v0.9.79 bundle: forming the group wakes the
// master, the quiet wake's own STOP tears down what the firmware had just
// restored, that disconnect arms the re-push watchdog, and 0.14 s after
// "zone: formed" it pushes back a station the user had switched off two minutes
// earlier. It went out over UPnP, which only STM drives, so it was not the
// speaker doing it.
//
// The guard that looks right and is not: quietWakeActive() is CLEARED BY the
// zone join, 0.31 s before the push lands. These tests pin the timing so that
// mistake cannot be made a fourth time.
