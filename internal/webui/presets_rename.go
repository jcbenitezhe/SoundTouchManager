// Renaming a preset: the one write path that changes what a key is CALLED and
// nothing else.
//
// Station names come straight out of the radio directory, and there they are
// sometimes shouted in capitals, wrong, or long enough to fill a whole tile
// ("the names are sometimes absurd, I want to rename what sits on my own keys",
// discussion). The store has always carried a free-form Name, so this only
// needs a way to write it.
//
// It deliberately does NOT go through the PUT save path, even though a rename
// could be expressed as a re-save of the same preset. Two things on that path
// are about the STATION, and a rename changes no station:
//
//   - the web-page probe (looksLikeWebPage) makes an outbound request per write
//     and refuses on positive evidence of an HTML page. A key saved before that
//     probe existed can hold such a URL, so renaming it would be answered with
//     "that address is the station's website" and the user could never fix the
//     name of a key that plays.
//   - the Spotify enrichment refills the name from the playlist title, and the
//     account/shuffle refresh fires against the live engine.
//
// The duplicate guard (one station on at most one key) is not a problem
// either way: it skips the slot being written, so a same-slot rename can never
// collide with itself. Coming in on its own verb keeps that true by
// construction rather than by a `continue` several hundred lines away.
