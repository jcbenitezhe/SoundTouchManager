// "Initiating a Spotify playlist via a preset key causes another preset
// key to auto-select and stream the radio station associated with that preset
// key." Three SoundTouch 10s, v0.9.80, Spotify on key 1 and a radio station on
// key 6.
//
// Her log has it in four seconds. The speaker was asleep, so the recall powered
// it on; the firmware resumed what it played last, which was key 6, 1.6 s
// before the recall of key 1 even ran; the recall then failed and nobody
// stopped the station the speaker had started by itself.
//
// The decision is small enough to state plainly, and stating it is the point:
// a recall undoes that auto-resume only when the speaker was ASLEEP when the
// recall began. On a speaker that was already playing, the same stop would take
// away music somebody had put on deliberately.
