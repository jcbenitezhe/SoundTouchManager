// What a stereo pair looks like in the Spotify app, and why STM got it wrong.
//
// Reported: a pair called "Grace pair (L+R)" shows up in the Spotify
// device list as the pair under its own name when the entry comes from the Bose
// firmware, and as its two halves, "Bose (Grace left) (STM)" and "Bose (Grace
// right) (STM)", when the entries come from STM. The owner then has to guess
// which half to pick, and picking either one is wrong: half a stereo pair is not
// a thing anybody wants to play to.
//
// The cause is one line of history. The engine runs per speaker and takes its
// Connect name straight from that speaker's own friendly name, so nothing on
// that path has ever known a pair exists. Everything needed to know it is
// already in the agent: the zone store says whether this box is in a stereo pair
// and whether it leads it, and the pair's display name lives in the marge group
// record, shared with the Bose app, which is why a rename in one shows up in the
// other.
//
// So while a pair is formed:
//
//   - the MASTER advertises the PAIR's name, and
//   - the FOLLOWER advertises nothing at all.
//
// The follower's engine is idle while paired anyway: the master's engine plays
// and the firmware distributes the audio to the other half. Its Connect entry is
// therefore not a feature that is being removed, it is an entry that could only
// ever have been picked by mistake.
//
// The follower's engine is SUSPENDED rather than reconfigured because the engine
// cannot be asked to stay quiet: zeroconf_enabled exists in go-librespot's
// config, and with credentials.type "zeroconf" the daemon forces it back to true
// before it is ever read (daemon/app.go). Checked in the fork rather than
// assumed.
