// Package spotify runs go-librespot as a persistent Spotify Connect
// receiver on the speaker and exposes its audio so the box can play it
// over UPnP, the audio plane of the Spotify-preset feature (P1).
//
// Why go-librespot (devgianlu) and not librespot-org:
//   - Hardware preset buttons 1..6 must recall a saved Spotify playlist
//     autonomously, with no phone app present. That needs the box to be
//     able to say "play URI X" by itself. librespot-org has no local
//     control API, so its only autonomous path is the Spotify Web API
//     with a refreshable OAuth token stored on the box (a security
//     surface we do not want). go-librespot ships a local HTTP API:
//     POST /player/play {uri} plays a URI using its own cached
//     credential, no token plane. See Play below.
//   - GPL-3.0 is fine here: go-librespot runs as a separate sidecar
//     process (exec + localhost HTTP). STM merely aggregates it; the
//     agent stays MIT. The binary is built, attested, audited and
//     credited separately.
//
// Audio shape:
//   - go-librespot runs with the STM Ogg-passthrough patch
//     (.github/patches/go-librespot-passthrough.patch) and
//     audio_output_pipe_passthrough. We point audio_output_pipe at
//     /dev/stdout so it writes the raw Ogg/Vorbis to its stdout (it logs
//     to stderr); the manager drains that and ServeOgg streams it to the
//     box, which decodes the Ogg natively over UPnP. This roughly halves
//     CPU on the weak A8 vs streaming decoded PCM (validated live).
//
// Credentials: zeroconf with persist_credentials. The user taps the
// device once in the Spotify app (the natural "connect to a speaker"
// flow); go-librespot persists the reusable credential under configDir
// and auto-logs-in on every later start, so API-driven recall works
// with no controller attached.
//
// Single consumer by design: one box plays one Spotify stream at a time.
// When no HTTP client is attached the audio is discarded so go-librespot
// never blocks on a full pipe.
