// boxlag.go: how far the audio the speaker is playing lags behind the audio
// STM has delivered.
//
// Why this exists. With STM's Spotify entry the lyrics in the Spotify app run
// ahead of the sound; with the speaker's own Spotify entry they line up (field
// report, 2026-09). The mechanism is understood: go-librespot reports its
// position from the bytes it has written to the pipe, while that audio is still
// on its way through STM's batch and the box's own buffer, and STM deliberately
// keeps roughly ten seconds there (see leadCapSec in engine.go and the chunk
// window in oggchain.go). The Spotify app therefore shows a position that is
// ahead of what the room hears, and the lyrics follow that position.
//
// What is NOT known is the size of the offset on real hardware, and nothing has
// ever recorded it. Any correction applied before that number exists would be a
// guess. This file measures it and does nothing else: no offset is applied, no
// behaviour changes.
//
// The two clocks:
//
//   - delivered: the drain publishes the continuous audio timeline of the last
//     page it accepted for the box (deliveredGran). That is the position
//     go-librespot has produced, i.e. the one the Spotify app shows.
//   - the box: UPnP GetPositionInfo's RelTime, the speaker's own account of how
//     much of this stream it has rendered.
//
// Both are measured from the moment the box received the first audio of this
// attachment (lagBaseGran is the delivered timeline at that page), so the
// difference is the audio in flight. The baseline is taken in the drain and not
// where the box attaches, because the two must share one instant: the engine
// keeps producing while no box is attached (engineHot, see recall.go), and
// basing on the counter's value at the previous detach folded that whole
// detached window into every later reading. Whether the box's RelTime really
// restarts on a re-attach is exactly what the attach measurement below is for:
// it is taken when both sides should read zero, so a bundle shows whether the
// boundary numbers can be trusted.
//
// What the delivered side deliberately does NOT count: audio the drain produced
// with no box attached, and audio a skip cut threw away. The box never received
// either, so its RelTime cannot contain it, and counting it would inflate every
// later difference by that amount (see drain.go).
//
// Event-driven only: once per attach and once per track boundary. No ticker, no
// standing poll - this runs on every speaker in the field and a periodic probe
// would cost NAND and CPU for a number that only changes when something happens.
