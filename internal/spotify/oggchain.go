// oggchain.go: artificial Ogg chain seams for long Spotify tracks.
//
// The Bose firmware retains memory in proportion to the audio it receives
// within ONE logical Ogg stream and frees it only when a new logical stream
// begins: a BOS page with a new serial. A normal playlist hands it a new
// stream every three to nine minutes, so MemAvailable stays flat for hours;
// a single 60-minute track is one logical stream for the whole hour,
// MemAvailable falls about 1.25 bytes per byte of audio, and the memory guard
// reboots the box after twenty to thirty minutes (field report 2026-09-07,
// SoundTouch 20 sm2, FW 27.0.6: 29.9 MB free -> 3.8 MB in 1092 s of one
// track, while 46 min / 45 MB of ordinary songs, one of them a single 15-min
// HTTP attach, moved nothing). An HTTP re-attach, a pause or a standby frees
// nothing; Bluetooth does not leak.
//
// So the drain cuts a long track into a chain of logical streams itself: the
// current page is flagged end-of-stream, the track's own three header pages
// are re-emitted under a fresh serial, and every following page is re-stamped
// with that serial and a contiguous page sequence, granule positions
// untouched. That is the intersection of three shapes the box already
// decodes today: a natural track end (EOS, then a BOS with a new serial), an
// app skip (BOS with a new serial, no EOS) and a late join (granule-0 headers
// followed by a large absolute granule). The decoder re-initialises from the
// identical headers and the firmware frees what it held for the old link.
//
// Cost: a naive cut loses the overlap between the last packet of the old link
// and the first of the new one (a quarter block each, a few milliseconds),
// heard as at most a tick every ten minutes of a long track. A primer packet
// that would make the cut sample-exact is deliberately not built until a
// hardware A/B says which decoder class the box runs: openLink is the hook.
//
// Trigger (only when the switch below turns the mechanism on): never inside
// the first chainMinBytes of a link, at the latest at the configured period, and earlier only when the memory can be attributed to
// THIS link: MemAvailable below chainLowWaterKB AND fallen by at least half a
// byte per byte of the link since the link's first probe (the field rate is
// 1.25) AND at least chainMemMinSec of audio in the link. Ordinary songs on a
// healthy box therefore never see a seam, a box that merely sits low for an
// unrelated reason only ever sees the chainPeriodBytes ceiling, and a leaking
// box seams well before it reaches the memory guard.
//
// Switch: /mnt/nv/stmanager/spotify-chain-mb, absent = OFF (byte-identical
// passthrough, the default since the hardware measurement of 2026-09-08
// recorded at chainPeriodBytes), 0 = off as well, 1..64 = the ceiling in
// MiB, which turns the mechanism on. Re-read at engine start, at every real
// track boundary and after every seam, never polled, so a change lands at
// the next boundary without a restart.
