// Package mdnshost answers mDNS address queries for exactly one name: the
// label STM gives this speaker.
//
// Why this exists. The Spotify engine advertises _spotify-connect._tcp with an
// SRV target taken from the box's Linux hostname, which on SoundTouch hardware
// is the Bose chassis codename: mojo on a SoundTouch 30, rhino on a 10, taigan
// on the Portable. Nothing on the network answers a query for that name. The
// mDNS library the engine uses only handles questions about its own service
// names and has no branch for a host name at all, so the address travels only
// as an extra record bundled into a service answer, with a lifetime of 120
// seconds while the service records carry 3200. A client that keeps the bundled
// address works; a client that looks the name up again gets silence. That is
// why the same speaker appears in Spotify on one network and not on another,
// and why it can drop out minutes later rather than immediately.
//
// The codename is also not unique. Measured on a five speaker network on
// 2026-08-17: three SoundTouch 10s all claimed rhino.local with three different
// addresses, and every one of those answers came from the router's cache, never
// from a speaker.
//
// So STM gives the engine a name of its own, derived from the device ID, and
// this responder is what makes that name mean something.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT do. It answers address questions for one label
// and nothing else: no service enumeration, no PTR, no SRV, no TXT, and never
// for the box's own hostname or for any name the Bose firmware publishes. The
// firmware's own records (Wohnzimmer.local, Bose-SM2-<mac>.local, its
// _soundtouch._tcp and AirPlay adverts) are left exactly as they are. Claiming
// a name someone else already owns would be the one way to make this worse than
// the bug it fixes.
