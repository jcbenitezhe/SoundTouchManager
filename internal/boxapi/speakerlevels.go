// speakerlevels.go: the front-center and rear-surround levels of a home
// theater system, which the SoundTouch Web API exposes as
// /audioproductlevelcontrols.
//
// Mail 2026-09-25, a SoundTouch 300 owner with two soundbars and Virtually
// Invisible 300 surrounds on each: the surrounds play, but their level can
// only be changed together with the bar. That is correct for anything STM did
// until now, because the surrounds hang off the bar's own wireless link and
// never appear on the network, so the only thing STM can address is the bar.
//
// The bar itself has the knob. The official Web API v1.1 documents
// frontCenterSpeakerLevel and rearSurroundSpeakersLevel on this route, gated
// exactly the way the tone controls are: use it only when /capabilities lists
// it. This file follows boxapi.toneControlsBass step for step, including the
// per-host verdict cache, for the same two reasons given there.
