// Replaying a media-server track from Recently played started it WITHOUT its
// file type, so the speaker got it through STM's endless-radio relay instead of
// fetching the file itself: the Wave labelled it internet radio, the bitrate
// read as a dash, the track never ended and the card was re-filed under Radio
//
// Three places dropped it. This one is the nastiest, because it means a card
// that was ever written without a mime stays broken for good: the fold fills
// CardArt, CardName, CardURL and Account when they are empty, and simply never
// looked at Mime. So the next play of the same card, carrying the mime, folded
// into the old row and the mime was thrown away again.
