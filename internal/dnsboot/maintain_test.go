// The order of nameservers on a speaker, and why it is worth a test.
//
// Go's resolver walks the list in order with a five second timeout each. The
// firmware gives a station five to ten seconds to start before it gives up. So a
// speaker whose resolv.conf asks a public fallback first pays longer to look up
// a station than the firmware is willing to wait, and NOTHING plays. Not one
// station: everything.
//
// That is the file a real speaker was found with, reported as "one station only
// works on one device". The speaker beside it, same household, same station,
// played fine, and the only difference was that its agent had started after the
// interface came up.
