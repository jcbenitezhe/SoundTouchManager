// Package dnsboot repairs a speaker that has no usable DNS resolver.
//
// Field case (2026-07-27, Wave): the box came up with no nameserver the
// agent could see, so Go fell back to its built-in 127.0.0.1:53 / [::1]:53
// pair and EVERY name lookup failed. That single fault produced three
// unrelated-looking symptoms and locked itself in place:
//
//   - Radio: the stream proxy could not resolve any station host, so the box
//     aborted the stream within ~400 ms and displayed "Service Unavailable".
//   - Clock and pairing: every clock-sync host was a NAME, so the clock stayed
//     at the 2015 firmware epoch; autopair is gated on a plausible clock, so
//     the box never paired and displayed "SoundTouch not configured".
//   - Spotify: go-librespot crash-looped on apresolve.spotify.com.
//
// Every repair path STM owns needed the very thing that was broken, so the box
// could not heal across reboots or re-installs. This package breaks that loop:
// it detects the missing resolver and bind-mounts a working resolv.conf over
// the read-only rootfs one, the same trick run.sh already uses for /etc/hosts.
// Fixing it at the file level (rather than only inside our own Go process)
// also repairs the Bose firmware's own name lookups, so its NTP starts working
// and the clock, autopair and the display heal on their own afterwards.
