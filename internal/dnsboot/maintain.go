package dnsboot

// Keeping the bootstrap resolver from outliving its usefulness.
//
// EnsureResolver runs at agent start and writes a resolv.conf when the speaker
// has none. On a boot where the agent starts before the interface is up there is
// no default gateway yet, so the file it writes contains ONLY the public
// fallbacks, and udhcpc appends the household's real resolver to that same file
// afterwards. The order it lands in is the order it stays in:
//
//	# written by STM (dnsboot): the box had no usable nameserver.
//	nameserver 1.1.1.1
//	nameserver 8.8.8.8
//	search lan # wlan0
//	nameserver 192.168.x.x # wlan0
//
// Go's resolver walks that list in order with a five second timeout each, so
// every lookup on such a speaker pays ten seconds before the resolver that
// actually answers is reached. The firmware's audio path gives a station five to
// ten seconds, so the speaker gives up before its own agent has finished looking
// the station up, and NOTHING plays. Measured in a two-speaker household on
// 2026-09-27: one ST20 with this file, ~50 stream attempts, not one upstream
// response, every session ending "bose disconnected" at exactly 5 s or 10 s. The
// ST10 beside it had no STM header in its resolv.conf and played the same
// station fine. Its agent had simply started after wlan0 came up.
//
// So this is a boot-order race in STM, not a difference between the speakers,
// and the same speaker would be fine on the next boot. That is what makes it
// worth a watcher rather than a better guess at startup: whatever the order was,
// the moment a real resolver appears the bootstrap entries must stop being asked
// first.
