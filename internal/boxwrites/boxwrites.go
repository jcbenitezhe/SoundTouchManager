// Package boxwrites is the box-write ledger: a tiny counter of every write
// STM performs against the speaker's own firmware (AddPreset/RemovePreset key
// registrations, setMargeAccount re-onboardings, autonomous UPnP pushes),
// keyed by the box's playback source at write time.
//
// It exists because "who wrote to the box at 3am, and was it asleep" is the
// question every overnight preset-loss bundle needs answered and none could:
// writes reset the firmware's deep-standby countdown and re-onboardings wipe
// the hardware-key registrations, so the ledger makes the write pattern a
// one-grep fact instead of an archaeology project. Counters only, no I/O of
// its own; the agent emits one aggregated WARN per hour at most and serves
// the running totals as a debug-state section.
