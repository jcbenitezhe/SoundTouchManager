// The routing is a switch whose cases each call a responder; a case that
// forgets its `return` writes its response and then falls out of the switch
// into the legacy fallback below, which matches on loose substrings ("source",
// "account", "preset") and appends a SECOND body to the same response. The box
// then receives two XML declarations and two root elements in one HTTP reply -
// not well-formed XML - and on the account sources route the appended document
// was an EMPTY source list, which is the worst possible thing to send a
// firmware that is deciding whether to keep a registered source.
//
// Measured live on an ST10 (2026-08-02) on /streaming/account/<acct>/sources.
// This test covers every route rather than that one path, because the defect is
// a missing keyword that any future case can repeat.
